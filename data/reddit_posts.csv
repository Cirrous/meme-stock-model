wallstreetbets,Discovering Opportunities In ‚ÄúSuperlongs‚Äù,"Before I begin, this is just a post to share my thoughts and potentially open some eyes to some solid opportunities in today‚Äôs market. This is not financial advice by any means.  So what is a superlong? It‚Äôs a term I use in regards to a stock that has been aggressively soaring for the last year with most trading days being green.  A few examples of superlongs are APP, SEZL, DAVE, SFM, TSSI, and PSIX, just to name a few.  Money can be made on each of these. The trend on these names is insanely strong and I doubt it comes to a halt anytime soon. Buying any of these now would likely make you a solid amount of money with a high confidence, but some of these are better than others.  If you find a superlong with the following criteria:  -Strong fundamentals -Somewhat decent valuation  -Nice chart -Lucrative industry  Then you‚Äôve found gold. Of these superlongs I‚Äôve listed, only a few meet those criteria: SEZL, DAVE and PSIX. Additionally, these three have great charts, all breaking out and above all key moving averages. The issue with SEZL and DAVE is that they are perhaps quite stretched, so they may have intermediate pullbacks. Additionally, their valuations are only decent at best, with SEZL trading at 50x earnings and DAVE trading at 70x, these names may have already experienced most of their rally.  This leaves PSIX. PSIX trades at 13x earnings, way better than a ‚ÄúSomewhat decent valuation‚Äù. Industry average for what PSIX does is 26x, meaning it is pretty undervalued by that metric. Additionally, it has a measly 1B market cap, which is significantly easier to push higher than a superlong like APP with a 100B market cap. They also grew revenue by 40% and earnings by 170% in the last 12 months. Generally companies with that level of growth deserve way higher multiples than 13x, but I digress. Lastly, the chart looks phenomenal. It‚Äôs rallying above all key moving averages (the 8, 21, and 200dmas) and it recently took out its 52week high meaning it‚Äôs in breakout mode. (Also 8/21EMAs crossed recently)  This honestly feels like SMCI when it was at $4 (post split) back in 2022. SMCI at the time was trading at 12x earnings and growing aggressively. It wasn‚Äôt that they didn‚Äôt deserve a higher multiple, it was that NO ONE KNEW ABOUT THE STOCK. I believe that is the same case with PSIX  But most importantly, what does PSIX do?  They make and sell a wide variety of power solutions - it‚Äôs in the name. PSIX sells engines used in pumps, compressors, industrial equipment, trucks, busses to make up half of their revenue. The juicier other half comes from energy generation and data centers üëÄ   Their energy solutions are a key component of data centers which are so hyped up by the market today. That fulfills the last bullet point of identifying opportunities in superlongs. PSIX has:  - Phenomenal fundamentals  - Insanely cheap valuation - Best chart I‚Äôve seen in a while - Lucrative industry exposure  The company is poised to continue growing. The stock is sitting at $50 a share and I think it goes to $70 sometime before August. Likely $100+ by end of year. Of all the superlongs to own, this is my favorite.  Thank you for reading üöÄ",2025-06-11T16:37:03,7

wallstreetbets,SMR tendies (not selling),My initial post on this stock got deleted a little over a week ago. Let's try again.   I have a very high conviction on nuclear stocks in the near future. AI boom = exploding energy needs. Nuclear is one of the only viable options for fixing this issue.   I believed retail sentiment has been weirdly neutral considering the massive institutional support and recent government approvals (specifically the early Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval for NuScale's SMR reactor).   Not selling my positions anytime soon. This is a mid-long term play IMO. Call me regarded idc.   I like the stock.

wallstreetbets,$TMC: Trumps Executive Order Makes Deep Sea Mining The Next Big Thing With 16 Trillion Dollars Worth Of Untapped Minerals,"**TLDR:** Deep Sea Mining is rapidly becoming a major industry, tapping into an estimated $16‚Äì20 trillion in untouched minerals. Geopolitical pressures, particularly with China, and the need for critical rare earth minerals have pushed the administration to initiate entry into this sector. **As the industry now is transitioning from exploration to commercialization, investing in this sector in my opinion is equivalent to investing in the Texas Oil Company in 1902 and is a once in a generation 10-50√ó play or Flop depending on how Things pan out... $TMC Stock Currently has the first mover advantage.**  **Edit TLDR addressing Environmental Concerns in comment section:** These metals are essential‚Äîwe're going to mine them one way or another. Harvesting them from deep-sea nodules is simply far less destructive than tearing apart forests, polluting rivers, or exploiting child labor on land. **The need is non-negotiable; choosing the cleaner, safer, and more humane/ethical source should be too.** Years of endless environmental red tape and political arguments put American innovation on hold while other countries raced ahead.  # A Market Worth Trillions Waiting to be Capitalized  Deep sea mining is a new industry **unlocking roughly $16‚Äì20‚ÄØtrillion worth of metals** that are still sitting untouched on the ocean floor. The first big prize sits in the Pacific: potato sized nodules scattered across the seafloor. Each nodule is packed with four easy‚Äëto‚Äëlift metals‚Äî**manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt**‚Äîingredients for everything from stainless steel and power cables to wind‚Äëturbine parts and the latest battery chemistries. After the nodules, miners can chase crusts on undersea mountains loaded with rare earths and **titanium, sulfide mounds along mid‚Äëocean ridges rich in zinc and gold,** and thick beds of **phosphate** that are vital for fertilizer. Even a small slice of these deposits could reset global supply chains and tilt the strategic balance.  # Why This Matters Now More Than Ever?  For decades deep‚Äësea mining stayed stuck. The tools to dig four miles down did not exist, and a global deal called the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) said no one could mine until countries wrote the rules together. **The United States never signed that treaty, so U.S. firms were sidelined. On 24 of April, a new executive order signed by Trump flipped the script: it told American agencies to give out their own seabed permits and get moving.** With China controlling many land‚Äëbased metals, Washington now sees the ocean floor as the backup supply. **That switch‚Äîfrom ‚Äúwait‚Äù to ‚Äúgo‚Äù‚Äîis what makes this moment urgent.**  # The Next Sector To Fly After AI and Quantum?  This sector just jumped from Exploration to initiation of Commercialization. The executive order threw open the doors, and the mining tech that engineers have been refining for a decade is finally cleared for action. **This setup for me feels exactly like the early days of AI or quantum Mania... For me, it's like buying into the Texas Oil boom back in 1902**: the ground floor, before drills hit pay dirt. With the tools tested, the permits coming, and demand for these metals only climbing, deep‚Äësea mining is starting its own gold‚Äërush moment...  # $TMC: First Mover Advantage  TMC (The Metals Company) has spent more than a decade quietly gearing up for this moment. Since 2011 the team has mapped the richest nodule fields in the Clarion‚ÄëClipperton Zone, partnered with heavy‚Äëhitters like Allseas to build a full‚Äëscale collector ship, and filed mountains of environmental data. What held them back wasn‚Äôt technology‚Äîit was red tape. Until now they needed the International Seabed Authority (ISA) to finish its rulebook. On 29 of April, it filed the **first‚Äëever** U.S. applications for two exploration licences and a commercial recovery permit under the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act. **NOAA formally logged the filings for a completeness check on May‚ÄØ30** and launched a 60‚Äëday clock to decide whether the applications meet all baseline requirements before a full technical and environmental review begins. At this pace, if everything goes according to plan, TMC could be clearing nodules **flying a U.S. flag even before the ISA finishes arguing over global rules.**  Moreover, China is not as advanced technologically as The Metals Company. ""I would characterize China as being two to four years behind them in terms of their technology,"" said Alex Gilbert of the Payne Institute, Colorado School of Mines.  # Edit: Addressing Environmental Concerns in the comment section  TMC isn‚Äôt rushing in blind. Over the last ten years they‚Äôve run 22 research trips, grabbed loads of data, and put most of it online for anyone to check. In a 2022 test, the stirred-up mud hugged the seafloor and settled fast. A peer-reviewed study says metals from these seabed rocks could **cut the carbon footprint by about half compared with digging on land. There‚Äôs no blasting, no giant waste pond, and no acid runoff because the rocks come up loose.**  Plus, the nodule plains they‚Äôre working on sit **four miles down in what scientists call an ‚Äúabyssal desert.‚Äù** It‚Äôs cold, dark, and food-poor, so biomass is tiny‚Äîfar less life per square meter than on a coral reef or even a coastal seafloor. **That means less habitat disruption per ton of metal compared with ripping up tropical rain forests or river valleys on land.**  **Land mining often tears down forests, drains rivers, and leaves huge tailings piles that can leak for decades.** It also pumps out far more CO‚ÇÇ because trucks, explosives, and smelters run nonstop. Meanwhile, big land-based **miners‚Äîespecially nickel and cobalt producers in Indonesia and companies that buy cobalt from small mines in central Africa‚Äîhave been pressuring their governments and the ISA to slow ocean mining since cheaper seabed metals would slice into their profits. Some of those same land mines have been tied to harsh, unsafe conditions and even child labor. If deep-sea metals can replace minerals dug by kids in dangerous pits, cut carbon by half, avoid wrecking forests, and disturb a sparsely populated deep-sea plain instead of a jungle, that sounds like a clear win to me.**  Endless ‚Äúgreen tape,‚Äù court fights, and stop-sign politics in the last administration pushed U.S. projects years behind. While Washington argued over climate talking points and the Green-New-Deal crowd blocked permits on land **and** sea, other countries kept drilling, digging, and patenting the gear we now need. **If we keep treating every new resource project like it‚Äôs the end of the world, we‚Äôll hand the entire supply chain to China‚Äîagain.** The new executive order finally cuts through that clutter, but only if we ignore the same old scare tactics and get moving.  What are your thoughts regards? That‚Äôs my read and might be totally wrong: deep‚Äësea mining is about to rewrite the playbook for critical minerals and for me looks like a once in a generation 10-50√ó‚Äëupside play that could lock in U.S. leadership on critical minerals Or a complete flop and could crash and burn lol.

wallstreetbets,Chime IPO is finally happening June 12 (Ticker: CHYM),"For anyone into fintech or following neobanks Chime‚Äôs going public next week on June 12, ticker CHYM on the Nasdaq. IPO price is expected to be around $24 $26 share. They‚Äôve got about 8.6 million users, mostly in the U.S., and they‚Äôre one of the more well known mobile banks. Prett solid revenue too hit $1.67B in 2024. Not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù bank technically they partner with Bancorp and Stride but for customers, it feels like a full-on bank. There‚Äôs been a decent amount of hype behind this IPO. Mainly because Chime‚Äôs a recognizable brand, and one of the first bigger fintechs to go public in a while. Some are thinking it could follow the same pattern we saw with early SoFi, Robinhood, etc. If you‚Äôre investing on a budget, you don‚Äôt need much to get in  $100 $150 gets you a few shares.

wallstreetbets,"Nut Before You Buy: Ditch the Pre-Nut Delusion, Trade with Post-Nut Clarity?","The existence of ""post nut clarity"" suggests the existence of ""pre nut delusion"".   For the uninitiated,  * **Pre-nut delusion:** It is defined as the arousal-driven fog where every ticker looks like a moonshot and risk feels like a myth. Dopamine and other neurochemicals firing on all cylinders, that amplify focus on reward and downplay risks or long-term consequences. * **Post-nut clarity:** It is defined as the reset button after nutting where dopamine dips, prolactin spikes, and suddenly your risk/reward radar is back online.  If we leverage that into trading, it seems to suggest in order to be at our very best and make the most rational decision, we should nut beforehand.   And hear me out, there may even exist an inbetween state between pre-nut delusion and post-nut clarity.   * **Mid-nut learning:** Instead of sitting on either side, what if we edge right at the boundary of elevated focus state where we can absorb and process information much faster to make better decisions?

If Uber moves to robotaxis, then those expenses move over to Uber, and even though Uber would keep 100% of the payment by users, it feels like a lot of it would be offset by these expenses. Any increase to their bottom line would be rather small. Or am I just crazy? Thoughts?

wallstreetbets,CRWV losing OpenAI,"OpenAI plans to add Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google cloud service to meet its growing needs for computing capacity, three sources told Reuters, marking a surprising collaboration between two prominent competitors in the artificial intelligence sector.  It is a win for Google's cloud unit, which will supply additional computing capacity to OpenAI's existing infrastructure for training and running its AI models, sources said, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters. The move also comes as OpenAI's ChatGPT poses the biggest threat to Google's dominant search business in years, with Google executives recently saying that the AI race may not be winner-take-all.   https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/openai-taps-google-unprecedented-cloud-deal-despite-ai-rivalry-sources-say-2025-06-10/  This is horrible for coreweave.

Alright degenerates, hear me out.  $MODG (Topgolf Callaway Brands) is about to do something that very few are paying attention to ‚Äî they‚Äôre spinning off their equipment division into a separate public company. This isn‚Äôt just corporate fluff ‚Äî this is potentially rocket fuel.  Here‚Äôs why you should care:  Topgolf is the crown jewel ‚Äì MODG owns Topgolf, which is basically the Dave & Buster‚Äôs of golf. Growing like crazy, expanding globally, and pulling in a younger demo. High margin, high growth, and borderline addictive for millennials and Zoomers.  The spinoff = multiple expansion ‚Äì Wall Street loves a ‚Äúpure play.‚Äù By splitting the slower, legacy equipment biz (Callaway clubs, balls, etc.) into its own entity, you free Topgolf from the drag. Investors can finally value Topgolf like a modern experiential brand, not a golf bag company.  Hidden value about to unlock ‚Äì Analysts have consistently undervalued the company due to its blended structure. Post-spinoff, don‚Äôt be surprised if institutions jump in with fresh eyes and new models. It‚Äôs not a stretch to see this re-rated hard.  Add in the fact that the spinoff is expected to finalize in Q3 2025, and we‚Äôre looking at a classic ‚Äúbuy before the break‚Äù setup.  What am I missing here?

When market opened I was hoping for a big selloff.  But man‚Ä¶.this stock is just a beast.  As soon as I saw the $70 level being reclaimed I slowly sold off all of my puts for a ~$7K profit.  I then decided to join the Bulls and flipped long only and bought 87 calls at a cost basis of $2.40 per contract.  The lesson of today is:  Don‚Äôt fight the tape kids.

Good news I think she still has some left in the tank and am letting the house money ride after pulling out a bit of the gains at the start of this month and regretting it ever since.   Why it‚Äôs worth a look now: 1) BNPL booming with younger generations and anyone with no money (aka most of us)  2)improving financials  with positive cash flow in the last earnings call looking good .  3) if consolidation occurs in this space Sezzle looks like a prime choice for a big player.   4)MOST IMPORTANT POINT Sezzle used to be a Twolves floor sponsor and are currently the jersey sponsor. Thats a big D move .   5) strong insider ownership ~53% last time I checked yahoo finance.   6) jimmy chill said sell on Sezzle a few weeks ago on his lighting round seems like a good inverse Kramer play.

wallstreetbets,Why Sweetgreen Is Undervalued,"So here‚Äôs my honest take on why I think Sweetgreen is undervalued compared to where it‚Äôs heading in the future. For some context, I‚Äôve been slowly accumulating shares since February 21st, 2023, with my first buy being 106 shares at $9.38. I currently hold 3,194.055 shares at an average cost of $23.66‚Äîwhich is about $9.61 higher than where the stock is trading today.  Anyway, here‚Äôs what I think is going right for Sweetgreen right now, and what‚Äôs not going so great:   What‚Äôs Going Well  1. Rewards Program Rolling Out Nicely They just launched a new rewards program that gives 10 points for every $1 spent‚Äîand they‚Äôre signing up 20,000 new members a week. This is huge because it‚Äôll let them target offers by customer segment and even individually, which is something that‚Äôs worked really well for other fast-casual chains to drive better same-store sales and revenue growth.  2. Infinite Kitchen Expansion = Big Efficiency Gains They‚Äôre on track to open 40 new stores this year, and at least 20 of those will be the new Infinite Kitchen format. Plus, they‚Äôll be opening their first Infinite Kitchen with a drive-thru, which could be a big deal down the road‚Äîdrive-thrus are super competitive but also super profitable if you do them right.  The Infinite Kitchen is already showing big improvements‚Äîlike around 700 basis points in margin boost mostly from labor savings, plus a potential 100 basis point COGS improvement. That‚Äôs at least 7 percentage points from labor and 1 point from COGS compared to similar stores without the tech.  The first Infinite Kitchen store hit a 26% restaurant-level margin in its first full month‚Äîthat‚Äôs way better than the 20.4% average across the chain at the time. Less staff, more accuracy, faster service. Huge win.  3. Right Target Customer Millennials and Gen Z are their core customer base‚Äîwhich is perfect because these groups really care about health, sustainability, transparency‚Ä¶ everything Sweetgreen leans into. Together they make up like 43% of the U.S. population. Long-term this is the group you want.  4. Revenue Still Growing Despite Everything Even with all the macro headwinds, fires in California (where a lot of their stores are), reduced marketing, and seasonal menu pullbacks, they‚Äôre still growing revenue at over 15% year-over-year. That‚Äôs not bad considering everything going on.   Valuation is Dirt Cheap Compared to Peers‚Ä¶  Here‚Äôs the kicker no one seems to be talking about‚ÄîSweetgreen is dirt cheap compared to the comps.  Right now they trade at a 2.1x EV/FY 2025 revenue multiple. That‚Äôs less than half of Chipotle‚Äôs valuation, and below Cava and even McDonald‚Äôs‚Äîwho‚Äôs also struggling to grow same-store sales right now.  Their guidance says they‚Äôll end FY 2025 with 286 stores (adding 40 this year), which puts their valuation at around $5.5 million EV per store. Chipotle is sitting at $16.2 million EV per store (with over 4,000 stores expected by year-end).  So yeah‚ÄîSweetgreen stores are underperforming right now. But the top-line pressure is mostly macro-related (stuff that should pass) and the margin squeeze should ease as they roll out more Infinite Kitchens.  For long-term investors willing to wait this out, this is a super cheap stock on both a revenue and per-store basis.   What‚Äôs Not Going So Well  1. Same-Store Sales Took a Hit Q1 2025 was rough‚Äîsame-store sales dropped 3.1%, which was the first negative comp since their IPO in 2021. People are spending less on discretionary stuff, and the fast-casual space is super competitive right now.  But I honestly think this is a temporary issue‚Äîthey‚Äôre in a weird transition period with the loyalty program, there were the California wildfires, and they pulled back seasonal menu items. My guess is by the back half of the year, comps will be back on track.  2. Portion Size Complaints = Real Problem This one is more anecdotal but I‚Äôve spent some time (probably way too much time) digging through social media and reviews‚Äîand there‚Äôs a common theme: people think portions are small for the price they‚Äôre paying. Price per calorie is way worse than competitors and that‚Äôs something they really need to fix if they want loyal, repeat customers.  The Infinite Kitchen should help with this since everything is measured perfectly‚Äîbut honestly I‚Äôm surprised these places don‚Äôt have like portioning spoons or scales for proteins to make sure staff isn‚Äôt shorting people. Seems like such an easy win.  3. Can They Get Loyalty Members to Come Back More Often? 20,000 new signups a week is great‚Äîbut if those people don‚Äôt come back more often, it won‚Äôt matter. They need to find a way to get those new members hooked and visiting more frequently. If they do, same-store sales could pop big time.   Why I‚Äôm Still Super Bullish  Look, despite all this, I think Sweetgreen has a shot to 10x in the next 5‚Äì10 years, which would get them to an $18‚Äì20 billion market cap. That‚Äôs not crazy when you look at Chipotle sitting at $70B and Cava at $10B.  Plus, they‚Äôve got tons of optionality left‚Äînew menu stuff, handheld items, healthy fountain drinks like kombucha (super high margin). This is a company going through a rough patch, but I think they‚Äôll come out the other side way stronger.   Disclosure: I‚Äôm long ~3,100 shares plus October 2024 call options.",2025-06-09T12:12:57,42

wallstreetbets,Verizon looks primed for a big rally.,"I'll keep this short and sweet, but here are the bullet points :  * Technically-speaking, VZ has been consolidating in a Bullish Pennant for weeks, it has reached the end of the pennant and looks poised to breakout. Call option volume has been picking up over this time, and puts have steadily been closing. * When QQQ falls, people tend to seek safety in stable, high-dividend stocks like VZ (which generates a high 6%+ dividend).  * Generally-speaking, VZ tends to be quite resilient when the market corrects. Especially when tech falls. If you put the 2 charts together, every time QQQ falls, VZ pumps. QQQ is forming a bearish divergence on the daily chart, and is looking ready to retrace a bit (there is also a gap fill that could occur down a little ways on QQQ, which could further fuel the pump in VZ). * Most of the volume recently seems to be hedge funds hoarding shares. I've been browsing through the trade history and options flow. The $45 call has 40K+ OI, I've watched OI on that strike alone double over the past week, the stock could get gamma-squeezed. Weekly volume is increasing. Sentiment is 85% bullish. \*weekly chart pictured\* * If tech stocks take a breather, which IMO it looks like they will this week, I think seeing 1 high volume green candle on VZ daily chart will confirm the breakout. * Analyst estimates range from $47-55 for the year, I think it could start climbing into that range soon. When VZ rallies, it tends to rally 10-20% over a couple of weeks. Depending on where you measure the pennant pole, the target would be from \~$50-$55.  I think if there is anything that causes people to seek shelter outside of the bond market, which has been struggling lately, VZ is a prime candidate, and from a technical analysis perspective, it looks primed to rally hard.  Do what you will with this information. Godspeed regards!  Ps. The stock doesn't ""only"" rally when tech ETFs sink, it just happens to correlate with those declines a lot of the time.",2025-06-09T00:57:37,0
wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll catch a nice dividend and bump in the next couple weeks. Argue with me,"BABA is seen as a China-specific cloud and commerce company. I think as they expand globally, a new excitement of growth will help the stock price. Especially as international cloud business might be more hesitant to use U.S. cloud computing given political instability.   Neither U.S. or China benefit from continued trade-war escalation. I do not anticipate any challenges of Chinese companies being listed in the U.S. stock exchange. Additionally, I think Xi recognized the self-inflicted harm of cracking down on Ma and other large domestic tech companies.",2025-06-08T21:45:34,86

wallstreetbets,"Godzilla and Shower Formation spotted on Bitcoin Chart, Bought $350k in IBIT Calls","Hello again. After a few drinks, I have bought $350k+ in Bitcoin December 2027 ITM calls and plan to buy another few hundred thousand worth of 2026 ITM calls.  Why you might ask? Godzilla. That's all, Bitcoin looks like Godzilla.  That little wiggle in 2024? That's the tail of Godzilla.  The current bump? You think that's resistance? No. That's just its hunched back. Godzilla just wanted to buy Sydney Sweeney's bathwater and had bad posture while glued to the checkout screen.   And from now until 2027? He's gotten his order shipped and he's ready to terrorize the bears again. That's when the bulky neck and forms.  Godzilla literally shoots laser beams and fire. People debate about 100 men vs 1 gorilla, but it's not even a debate that 21 million Bears can't even scratch this monstrosity.  Because Bitcoin looks like Godzilla on the chart, I expect IBIT to reach $100+ and bought ITM calls to make a few hundred percent. Sydney Sweeney taking a shower formation also means IBIT is a buy.",2025-06-08T14:34:42,425
wallstreetbets,"Powell praying AI paying, boomers buying  and you wanna short this","Honestly I still don‚Äôt get why people are so aggressively bearish. Like yeah, consumer data looks weak, retail earnings are trash, housing is soft  cool we get it. That‚Äôs been true for months  But have you actually looked at what moves the market right now?     Big tech is absolutely ripping  AI isn‚Äôt some future fantasy  it‚Äôs real spend, real revenue, real margins. Nvda adds $300B in a week, Msft printing, Goog melting up  even Apple finally waking up. That‚Äôs literally half the index. And people think the S&P‚Äôs just gonna collapse? Lmao     Every week I see the same doom porn  credit cracks, recession lurking, ‚Äúthis time it‚Äôs different‚Äù  and yet price action doesn‚Äôt care. You know why? Because when stuff does start breaking, the Fed eases. They don‚Äôt want a crash heading into an election year. They‚Äôll pivot the second things get messy   And the fear over rising delinquencies‚Ä¶ yeah no kidding. What did you think would happen after the fastest hiking cycle in 40 years? Obviously credit gets tight. But this isn‚Äôt 2008. Unemployment is still under 4%, corporate balance sheets are solid, and the system isn‚Äôt imploding Chill     The market‚Äôs not pricing in perfection. It‚Äôs pricing in ‚Äúslightly less bad‚Äù and ‚Äúmaybe we get cuts‚Äù. Yields are easing, buybacks are rolling, and there‚Äôs no alternative that yields 30% YTD like $Qqq.

Everyone‚Äôs still hiding in T-bills and buying puts   You really think the S&P dumps while Apple is buying back stock like it‚Äôs a religion and boomers are auto-buying every paycheck? Come on     And don‚Äôt even get me started on the Fed Powell‚Äôs out here praying the soft landing meme becomes real. They‚Äôre not raising again. They‚Äôre literally looking for a reason to cut.

A key point also noted was its working. Consumers are choosing to pay just a bit more for Shake Shack burgers than other fast food chains.

wallstreetbets,why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now,"With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).  Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*  Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...  I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.  # ----------- Fundamentals -----------  Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.  \-  **AI:**    *VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.  **Data Centers / Internet Provider:**  \-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..  **Quantum Computing:**  \------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.  **Smart Phones:**  \------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time  **Streaming / Ads:**  \------*Youtube & Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix  **Smart Home / Wearables:**  \------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.  **Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**  \------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*  **AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**  \------*Verily, & Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.  \-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.  \-  When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...  [Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)  \-  Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.  https://preview.redd.it/a61jyxhzwl5f1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b85188b91cd7b2b6b95516e18513586d86d630b  \-  # -------- Technical Analysis --------  so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...  I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.  I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.  \- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.  \- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.  \- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.  \- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.  https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f  Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.  But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.  From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.  While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.  \--------------  # TLDR:  **Alphabet is a great Bet !**  I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.  **Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.  *Price Target short term - 180*  *Price Target long term - 200+*  thanks for getting this far into my regarded ted talk, give it a chance!",2025-06-08T03:04:03,508

wallstreetbets,Perfectly Timed Tesla Puts (Gain and DD),"Regards Retards,  Gonna try to keep this short.  I am writing this as a Tesla owner (love that car) and former Tesla bull.  I actually bought Tesla shares the day after the election, but then sold them at $385 for the initial $14,659.15 gain.    When the Doge problems started being apparent, I started buying puts, hit the downslope decently from above $300 to the $240s.  Got out pre earnings to avoid IV crush and because for some reason TSLA always moons on earnings no matter how bad they are.  +\~$32K      Last week, I started to get that itch again thinking, man TSLA is gonna go down again...didn't have any position...was thinking about it.  Then, as soon as Elon walked into the Oval Office with that black eye, I was literally tripping all over myself on both the phone and CPU to buy puts.  I think I got in at about 360 - 355 for the 7/11 dated puts, but TSLA was dropping fast as I was buying those.        Then there was today, which was just amazing.  The stuff that dreams are made of.  Chef's kiss.      Degenernates, it is my hypothesis that this is not over.  Tesla can go much, much, much lower.  Setting aside the ridiculous valuation, declining sales, and toxic brand.  The biggest asset that Tesla had, it's closeness to the Whitehouse, is now its biggest liability.  The US government can hurt TSLA in so many ways:    * TSLA is operating under numerous Federal and State level permits that can come under scrutiny  * Just yesterday, I watched a video of an FSD Tesla tragically unalive a pedestrian, might the company face criminal liability? (BTW they should call it F\*\*king Scary Driving, I've tried it out, no way am I getting in a Robotaxi)  * Elon Musk has regularly done things (tweeting, self-dealing) that could warrant SEC investigations  * Elon Musk could easily be picked up on drug charges  Anyway, I wanted to get this out in case anyone is still holding:¬†**Sell. Right now.**¬†After-hours, pre-market, doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äî just sell.  Some bigger fool will still give you 280, but only today.  There is no reason for a bounce. The meme lords will not ride in to save you. Don‚Äôt let sunk cost fallacy wipe you out.  There is no floor here. This stock is facing a fiscal and regulatory apocalypse with no edge and no center.     \*\*\*\*DISCLAIMER   This is not financial advice and I am not authorized to give it.  It contains forward looking statements with great inherent uncertainty.  You would be stupid to listen to a gay bear retard such as myself (don't you see that I bought SPY puts right before it mooned).",2025-06-05T23:43:43,173
wallstreetbets,$72.7K Profit on TSLA Puts Today Because Elon Can‚Äôt Help Himself and TSLA Bulls are in a Cult,"Initiated TSLA July 18th 280 Puts on Tuesday because I think the Austin Robotaxi reveal would be a dud.  Waymo is much further along in autonomy.  The Austin Robotaxi reveal is basically a carefully curated theatrical attempt at autonomy.  It‚Äôs Level 2 and nowhere close to Level 3 or 4 autonomy.  AMZN also announced today they‚Äôre going to use robots to help with packaging/delivering.  There goes the TSLA robotics premium.

Nobody trusts FSD, nobody would hop in a Tesla when they could easily get a Waymo that has been tested for multiple years. Press is going to be watching like a hawk for any mishaps/bugs, which there will be. This is definitely not going to be what investors were hoping for.      2) Robotaxi release is high-risk, expect to see investors close positions leading up to the event. Cue in any number of videos showing FSD mowing down pedestrians or showing how bad a camera-only system is. I wouldn't want to risk a large position going into this. This whole robotaxi venture was dead the moment Enron refused to put LiDAR on the cars.      3) There was hype surrounding Enron's departure from the administration. Would've taken a goddamn miracle but honestly if he left the administration quietly, making sure not to burn any bridges, maybe he could save the brand a bit while still getting the benefits of being close to the admin. Except now he's getting in brawls with the administration and trashing their bill. He's burning all the bridges.  4) Declining sales and other stuff that doesn't actually affect the stock price at all.  5) CPI next week, likely to actually start showing the effects of tariffs.  Started my account this year and I'm up about $96k (img attached for proof) so combine that fact with this being a regarded TSLA play, I'm fully ready to lose all this shit.",2025-06-05T14:56:09,919

wallstreetbets,SPY vs SPX,"So I used to trade SPY every day. Nice liquidity, cheap contracts, vibes were good. Until tax season hit me like a margin call and I realized half my gains were going to the government. Cool. Love that.  Then I found SPX. Big brother version. Ten times the size. Zero assignment risk. And Uncle Sam only takes 23 percent thanks to that sweet 6040 rule. If you don‚Äôt know what that is, congrats, you‚Äôre about to save a fat chunk on taxes.  SPY is an ETF. Every gain is short-term capital gains. SPX is an index. It‚Äôs cash-settled. The IRS treats 60 percent of your gains as long-term even if you sell five minutes later. That means if you‚Äôre trading SPX and making money, you‚Äôre keeping a lot more of it. It adds up fast.  Also, no risk of early assignment. No waking up to some random shares you didn‚Äôt ask for. SPX options are European style and cash-settled, which means it just gives you money or takes your money. No shares. No drama.  Now if you trade straddles or spreads like I do, SPX just moves cleaner. SPY gets wrecked on sideways chop. SPX holds value better and doesn‚Äôt collapse like a dying meme coin when nothing happens.  Only downside? SPX contracts are pricey. Like 2000 bucks versus 200 for SPY. But the thing is, one SPX contract moves like 10 spy contracts. You don‚Äôt need to size up like a degenerate. One good play and it prints, (or takes your soul).   SPX gang. Less tax. Cleaner trades. Fewer headaches.  So which do you prefer and why?   If you‚Äôre not profitable, please ignore.",2025-06-04T20:29:22,261

As interest rates remain elevated, high growth, high multiple, low ROIC stocks will remain unattractive. This stock and industry has historically been a defensive play due to its inelasticity.      Okay now lets get to the meat and potatoes. First off, I could be somewhat early we have seen the stock trade flat for the last 2 weeks around $302 a share. This is a good sign of resistance towards the bottom after an incredible 50% dip. The question is, how long will this sideways trading continue? So keep that in mind before you decide to follow me on my quest. Remember, in the stock market you can have only one priority. You can either be right, or you can make money.      Im not a master of the crayon drawing but looking at our technicals, the stock is clearly over sold. In the 3 month view, RSI is oversold and MACD just crossed over.

The good old US of A. The probability that this corporation will be found guilty in my opinion is very low, just look at the recent trial for Boeing. What will most likely happen is a partial dismissal and UNH will pay out a few billion dollars which will also play out over several years. No biggie. Certainly no cause for us regards in 2025 as look to print tendies.

I looked into this when my wife came home with the wrong type of thumb drive for her stupid Macbook (a Sandisk that requires a USB - thank you Apple for removing those fucking ports on everything). Was curious if this was a company I could short and then learned what they were doing. Now I think this is a sleeper pick that nobody's really paying attention to.  **Product deep dive:**  * NVIDIA certified Sandisk‚Äôs Gen5 eSSDs for datacenter use. Certification means they're officially in the vendor chain for AI servers. * Additionally, they've also built something called High Bandwidth Flash (HBF) which is a new memory architecture built for massive memory capacity and throughput (important for AI). Nobody else is making this and it's developed in-house (one of the main reasons I bought). * Sandisk is shipping one of the most power-efficient flash technologies available right now, BiCS8. * Cloud sales‚Äî12% of Sandisk‚Äôs total output went to AWS/GCP/Azure this quarter, up from 8% a year ago. My employer is one of these and our AI spend is essentially a blank check. It's kind of an arms race right now. * AI spend isn't going to stop. I work in a part of a FAANG where we're seeing complete transformation plans to overhaul our customer-facing service into an AI-heavy experience. Yes a lot of companies are bleeding money on this but a lot aren't. I see the sales numbers and the internal productivity boost we've gotten is insane.  **Brand shift:**  Yes they do still make consumer stuff. But IGAF about thumb drives sold at Walmart. What they are building gives them a seat at the table for large AI-related deals.  **Earnings TLDR:**  * Revenue: $1.7B * Adjusted free cash flow: $220M * Cash on hand: $1.5B * Forecast: demand strengthening through year-end * Gross margin took a hit (22.7%), but they‚Äôre working on it through pricing and cost controls  This was their first full quarter as a standalone company after separating from Western Digital. Still early.  **Other areas they‚Äôre moving into:**  * **EV**: Flash tech being used for autonomous driving, just nominated Ford Supplier of the Year. NOTE: I am not an EV person and haven't really gone down this rabbit hole. I'm just looking into the AI side. * **Gaming**: Their new SSDs are winning ‚ÄúBest Of‚Äù awards * **Content creation**: Rolled out pro-grade memory cards and high-performance portable SSDs  **Risks:**  * Gross margins were down this quarter‚Äîmostly due to pricing pressure and the usual NAND volatility * Consumer segment is still soft * Goodwill impairment made GAAP numbers ugly (-$1.8B), though this was non-cash and tied to the separation * This is absolutely a lotto play. * Thin options liquidity.

wallstreetbets,1.3m $RDDT Bet - Too Many Ways to Win,"[YOLO my retirement](https://preview.redd.it/b79sltwwbx4f1.png?width=2762&format=png&auto=webp&s=2da693c6e85ac91a950290dc6ef77677fb3fb36b)  **TL;DR:** Reddit is massively under monetized compared to peers (ARPU of $3.63 vs Meta's $12+), but sitting on the internet's highest quality dataset for AI training. They're already making $100M+ annually from OpenAI/Google at 90%+ margins, with new revenue streams emerging (hedge fund data via ICE, premium subreddits targeting the creator economy). Management has proven they can monetize without killing the community. Multiple ways to win (ARPU growth, data licensing expansion, creator monetization).  Thesis: Reddit is the last major platform with truly authentic, human driven conten and every dollar they make from data, ads, or subscriptions flows almost entirely to the bottom line. That combination (community moat + 90% margins + under monetized user base) means there are tons of ways for shareholders to win.  **Moat/Why Reddit Matters**  Reddit‚Äôs value is in its data. Unlike algorithmic feeds that amplify engagement optimized content, Reddit's community moderated format naturally filters for substantive discussion through upvoting and downvoting mechanisms. This creates a self curating dataset where quality content rises organically. Reddit's niche communities offer domain expertise at scale. Subreddits such as r/AskHistorians or r/PersonalFinance provide high quality, contextual knowledge that is hard to find elsewhere. While other platforms deal with increasing bot activity and AI generated content pollution, Reddit's community moderation creates natural quality controls. Compare this to Meta or Twitter, where content moderation costs eat into margins. Reddit's community does the curation work for free, then Reddit monetizes that curation.  ¬†  That makes Reddit a data goldmine for LLMs.  This creates a flywheel of engagement that‚Äôs not only sticky for users but incredibly valuable to AI and advertisers.  * Reddit is already pulling in \~$100M/year from data licensing deals with OpenAI and Google. * That revenue flows almost entirely to the bottom line, pushing gross margins >90%. * Unlike ad reliant platforms, this is pure margin, recurring revenue. * Reddit has content tagged by subreddit leading to specific and niche domain knowledge which is super valuable for AI training.¬†  **The CEO and Why Management Can Execute**¬†  Steve Huffman cofounded Reddit in 2005 but left in 2009 to pursue his own startup journey. At Hipmunk, he gained hands on experience with the monetization challenges Reddit would eventually face: negotiating ad partnerships, building affiliate revenue streams, and learning how to balance aggressive growth targets with maintaining user trust skills that weren't part of his original toolkit as a pure product founder.  When Huffman returned as CEO in 2015, Reddit was stagnant,   traffic growth had slowed, leadership was paralyzed by fear of change, and basic revenue infrastructure was missing. But he now brought a different perspective, having personally wrestled with the complexities of turning user engagement into sustainable revenue.  His turnaround demonstrates he can execute on complex monetization without destroying community value. He overhauled the interface, built mobile functionality, and completely revamped Reddit's ad offerings. More importantly, he implemented content policies and moderator tools that preserved Reddit's authentic culture while making it advertiser friendly.  This experience matters for the opportunities ahead premium subreddits, expanded data licensing, international ARPU growth because they all require the same delicate balance Huffman learned through his entrepreneurial journey: extracting maximum revenue from unique community assets without killing what makes them valuable.  **Growth Catalysts**  **ARPU Tailwinds vs. Facebook/Google/Meta**  Reddit‚Äôs ARPU is currently well below its peers and management is actively working on closing the gap.  Current ARPU Gap:  * US ARPU: $6.21 (+31% YoY) * Intl ARPU: $1.34 (\~5√ó lower than US) * Global ARPU: $3.63 (+23% YoY) * Google Benchmark: Google Services generated $77.3 b in Q1 2025 (including $50.7 b search), with ‚Ç¨6.35 p/m in Europe (\~$76 per year). * Meta Benchmark: Meta‚Äôs ARPP was $10.42 per user in Q1 2025 (\~$12.36 TTM).  If Reddit can even approach half of Meta‚Äôs or Google‚Äôs yield in key markets, ARPU can more than double from here. When Reddit doubles ARPU from $3.63 to \~$7, you're looking at revenue growth with 90%+ gross margins. Even with zero DAU growth, that's \~$3B in annual revenue. Add conservative 20% DAU growth to 130M users, and you're approaching $3.6B in revenue. Right now Reddit‚Äôs market cap is 20B with the potential to generate $500M+ in quarterly free cash flow at those levels. And here is how they are going to do it.¬†  To increase ARPU Reddit is rolling out:  1. New ad formats (video, search, shopping) & better targeting & analytics for advertisers 2. AI powered content recommendations (already +30% in ‚ÄúGood Visits‚Äù) 3. Global machine translation (30+ countries)  I‚Äôm unsure if Reddit Answers will move the needle but it shows that the team is shipping fast and not afraid to experiment.¬†  **Emerging Data Monetization Beyond AI Training**  Reddit is now piloting financial data products through ICE, selling real time sentiment analysis and trend identification to hedge funds. This presents another new potential revenue stream. While still early stage, the addressable market for financial sentiment data is enormous. If Reddit can demonstrate alpha generation from their community discussions, institutional demand could create substantial revenue. Reddit's threaded discussions and voting mechanisms create cleaner sentiment signals than traditional social media noise. If Reddit can prove their data moves markets, they're looking at potentially hundreds of millions in annual recurring revenue from the finance vertical alone.  The speculative angle is whether other industries (healthcare sentiment, brand monitoring, political analysis) follow suit once Reddit demonstrates the model works with financial services.  **The Trump Call**  Anger is the most contagious emotion, and Trump makes people furious, which translates directly to engagement and revenue. During Trump's 2017-2021 term, NYT stock tripled (+227%) on the back of outrage fueled subscription growth, proving that political chaos drives monetizable engagement. Reddit thrives in this environment even more than traditional media. The platform's political subreddits already drive massive traffic during controversies r/politics regularly dominates the front page during major news cycles, and angry users spend significantly more time on platform, driving ad revenue and engagement metrics. As Trump continues generating daily headlines and controversies, Reddit becomes the primary destination for realtime discussion and debate. Unlike passive news consumption, Reddit's format encourages users to engage, argue, and scroll for hours through comment threads. This sustained engagement during Trump's presidency should provide a meaningful tailwind for both user growth and time spent on the platform, directly benefiting Reddit's advertising revenue and data value.  **Premium Subreddits**  Right now, NSFW content creators are farming engagement on Reddit for free, then redirecting traffic off platform to make money elsewhere. Reddit sees none of that profit. Reddit has explicitly discussed that they are working on premium subreddits. This keeps users on platform, and skims off that monetization by allowing creators to monetize directly on platform, with Reddit taking a platform fee.  Think OnlyFans creators paying Reddit a cut instead of just leeching traffic. This represents 100% incremental revenue with virtually zero marginal cost to Reddit as they're already hosting the content and communities.  OnlyFans generated $6.6 billion in gross payments volume in 2023, translating to $1.3 billion in revenue at a 20% take rate and $657 million in pretax profit. If Reddit's premium subreddit model can capture even a small fraction of this creator economy by leveraging their existing massive NSFW user base and superior community features it could substantially add to their revenue mix.  **Near Term Catalysts**  Reddit faces several key institutional milestones that could drive significant passive capital inflows. Russell 1000/3000 inclusion is scheduled for June 27, 2025, after market close, which should trigger automatic buying from index tracking funds starting that Friday. More significantly, if Reddit maintains its current profitability trajectory and scale, S&P 500 eligibility could arrive by mid 2026. The company's Annual Investor Day on June 9, 2025. I‚Äôm unsure if anything will serve as a catalyst for anything I‚Äôve mentioned here but I‚Äôm excited to hear what their team is working on.¬†  **The Google Risk and Why It Doesn‚Äôt Matter**  Reddit‚Äôs top line still depends heavily on Google‚Äôs search algorithm, so whenever Google tweaks its ranking, Reddit‚Äôs traffic and revenue can swing. After Reddit reported Q4 2024 results in late February, the stock sold off sharply when search rankings dipped. The same thing happened in May, despite a strong Q1 2025 beat (year over year revenue up 47%). On the Q1 call, Steve Huffman cautioned that ‚Äúgrowth will be bumpy,‚Äù noting that April daily active user growth slowed to 17%. Then the stock gave up its gains.  In reality, those monthly fluctuations don‚Äôt change the bigger picture: Reddit is still adding users and monetizing them at a fast clip. Short term search volatility simply means revenue and growth will be bumpy, but the overall trend remains squarely upward. The market is overplaying Reddit‚Äôs ‚ÄúGoogle dependency‚Äù. Even with occasional dips, Reddit‚Äôs growth trajectory is intact. Ignore the volatility and focus on the overall trajectory.",2025-06-04T14:53:04,874

Tesla‚Äôs rollout of its robotaxi service in Austin is supposed to kick off June 22 but there‚Äôs worry Trump might use federal regulators to slow things down kind of a political roadblock that could hit Tesla‚Äôs growth hard  Tesla shares bounced back almost 2% early Wednesday, recovering some of last week‚Äôs losses when the Musk-Trump drama blew up  From an investor‚Äôs perspective  how do you see this playing out? Does Musk‚Äôs ‚Äúsorry‚Äù move calm the waters enough to keep Tesla on track? Or is the political heat going to keep putting a ceiling on Tesla‚Äôs potential?",2025-06-11T16:36:02,0
stocks,China and the U.S. have negotiated a ‚Äúframework‚Äù and the market is taking a breather  but will it be different this time?,"The US and China just wrapped up two days of closed-door talks in London, saying they reached a ‚Äúframework‚Äù agreement aimed at implementing what was agreed on last month in Geneva. Basically it‚Äôs about cooling down the recent string of tensions  On the surface, it looks like some progress: China might speed up shipments of rare earth metals in exchange for the US easing some export controls on chips. Trump even posted on social media that the ‚Äúdeal is done‚Äù and threw out a 55% total tariff number  but the White House later clarified that number is just adding up existing tariffs so it feels a bit shaky  The key point is this ‚Äúframework‚Äù doesn‚Äôt actually cut tariffs in any meaningful way and the process seems slow. The market‚Äôs reaction was muted: Dow up a bit, S&P slightly down.  Here‚Äôs the question: we‚Äôve seen countless deals like this before  all talk, little action. How should the market price in a situation where things aren‚Äôt getting worse but aren‚Äôt really improving? Especially after this 90-day pause ends  if they don‚Äôt make progress will tariffs ramp back up?  Another question is, even if rare earth exports increase, will the US really ease chip export controls? National security has been the excuse for years  would relaxing controls now be a big turnaround or just a small window for semiconductor stocks?  Lastly, do you guys buy this deal? Or is it just what Shehzad Qazi calls a ‚Äúshaky truce‚Äù? Especially for China  related stocks and semiconductors  is this optimism peaking?",2025-06-11T16:29:36,10

stocks,"$DFDV - MSTR, but Solana","DFDV (DeFi Development Corp) currently holds 621,313 SOL, worth approximately $103.6 million at today‚Äôs SOL price of $166.68. The company is publicly listed, and its stated strategy is to accumulate SOL as a core treasury asset. Its current market cap is around $394 million, implying a NAV premium of roughly 3.8x.  This premium reflects market expectations that DFDV will continue expanding its SOL holdings, either via additional capital raises or reinvestment of staking yield (SOL currently yields ~10% when staked). It also reflects the scarcity of public vehicles that provide direct exposure to SOL.  Recent news also highlights that the odds of a SOL etf approval has gone up to 91 percent via poly market. SOL could rapidly expand and take share from alts.  If the company raises capital and doubles its SOL holdings to ~$207.2 million, and the premium expands to 4.2x in a strong Solana market environment, that would imply a market cap of about $870 million. This would equate to a share price around $420, or approximately 121% upside from current levels.  In a more bullish case where SOL reaches $300 and DFDV still holds double its current SOL balance, NAV would rise to about $373 million. At a 4.5x premium, which is not unreasonable during periods of heightened interest and momentum, this would suggest a $1.68 billion market cap and a share price near $811. That‚Äôs around 326% upside from here.  This investment is inherently speculative and depends on several variables, including the price of SOL, the company‚Äôs ability to raise and deploy capital, and market willingness to maintain or expand NAV premium.  ‚∏ª  Disclosure: Long DFDV equity and some out-of-the-money call options.

stocks,Forget NFP the Gov is Openly LYING about The Stats,"Nonfarm payrolls and unemployment data have become straight up  propaganda. The numbers look great on release, the market rallies, and then two months later we find out they were revised downward by 200k to 300k. Last year alone at end of 2024 the ENTIRE YEAR‚Äôs total employment numbers was revised down by over 1 million (that‚Äôs right over 1 million jobs were completely made up and nonexistent. It‚Äôs not incompetence,  it‚Äôs narrative management. The goal is so obviously to avoid spooking investors while buying time. But eventually, reality breaks through. And it won‚Äôt be because of some BLS press release. It‚Äôll be because a few real, untamperable data points start flashing red at the same time.     The Real Indicators That Will Break the Market   1. Initial Jobless Claims (and the 4-week average) This is clean, fast data from the states. If claims stay above 300k for four weeks in a row, the soft landing fantasy is dead. Continued claims rising means laid-off workers aren‚Äôt getting rehired  game over. 2. Temp Jobs and Part-Time Work for Economic Reasons Temporary employment always goes first. When you see temp jobs collapse and a spike in people working part-time because they can‚Äôt find fulltime work, that‚Äôs labor market distress the Fed can‚Äôt hide behind a strong NFP headline. 3. CMBS Defaults and Office Space Liquidations Commercial real estate (especially office space)  is an open wound. Once delinquencies in commercial mortgage-backed securities spike past 9 percent, especially in markets like NYC or SF, that stress bleeds directly into regional banks. If one of them breaks, it‚Äôs 2008 again but with Zoom accounts and ghost skyscrapers. 4. High Yield Credit Spreads and CCC Bond Yields When junk bond spreads break 600 to 800 basis points over Treasuries, smart money exits. This signals a deep freeze in credit markets. No credit = no growth. If spreads blow out while equities are still at ATHs, the disconnect doesn‚Äôt last long. 5. Retail Sales and Freight Volume Hard economic activity. You can‚Äôt fake this. If Cass Freight and truck spot rates drop off a cliff, and retail sales ex-gasoline go negative for multiple months, it means people are broke and companies are bleeding. 6. Earnings Revisions and Margin Guidance (Q3‚ÄìQ4 2025) Eventually, CEOs stop lying. They‚Äôll start warning about margin compression from weakening volumes and sticky input costs. When earnings per share forecasts get revised down 10 percent or more for the S&P, the illusion dies. That‚Äôs when the indexes collapse regardless of what the BLS says.   When It All Comes Together   This crash won‚Äôt be triggered by a bad jobs print. It will be triggered when these real signals start hitting at once, making it obvious the labor market data is lagging and meaningless. The moment corporate earnings revisions, credit market panic, rising defaults, and collapsing logistics converge that‚Äôs when the market stops front-running optimism and starts front-running bankruptcy. It won‚Äôt be a slow grind down. It will be a sharp repricing once the bond market stops believing the Fed and the equity market stops believing the headlines.

stocks,"Tesla: The First Robotaxi Video Shows a Dangerous, Illegal Turn","For context, a Reddit user posted this clip of the first Tesla Robotaxi in Austin: [https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1l855x7/first\_ever\_footage\_of\_tesla\_robotaxi\_testing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1l855x7/first_ever_footage_of_tesla_robotaxi_testing_in/)  As you can see in the clip, the Tesla begins turning while there are pedestrians in the crosswalk, likely because it is camera-only and does not detect the pedestrians in that specific location.  Instead of waiting for the pedestrians, it instead stops in the middle of the intersection, while making a left turn on a non-protected green.  The vehicle comes to a rolling stop, in the middle of the road, with the passenger side completely exposed to oncoming traffic.  Despite pedestrians being in the crosswalk, the vehicle continues to slowly roll instead of coming to a complete stop, putting the vehicle in the worst possible position of being both in the way of traffic and moving towards pedestrians.  We can also see that the lead Tesla, the Robotaxi, applies the breaks aggressively, with little care or notice as to what or who is behind it.  If this clip was shown to a driving test instructor, and they were told it was a clip of a new driver, that driver would fail the test instantly.  This Tesla managed to put the pedestrians, on-coming traffic, and the vehicle behind it in danger at the same time.  All of this is likely due to Tesla's unique insistence that FSD can be achieved safely with vision only, as Tesla cuts costs by not including a full array of sensors similar to how Waymo works.  I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Musk has ruined his reputation over the past year and the TSLA stock is being propped up by low-volume retail traders that are praying for a future Musk promises, yet never comes.  I feel Tesla has rushed out the Robotaxi program to distract from an incoming terrible quarterly report, and they've clearly done so at the expense of safety.  My best case scenario for Tesla is that the Robotaxi is safer than it seems and struggles to gain market from Waymo, and they fail to add anything significant to the bottom line.  My worst case scenario is that a Robotaxi fails to see a pedestrian and kills them, essentially killing any dream of Tesla Robotaxis in the 2020's.  Full disclosure: I am currently long on TSLQ, an ETF that attempts to match double the inverse of Tesla's daily performance.  For anyone unfamiliar with inverse ETFs, that means I am extremely bearish on Tesla, and have taken a position which will explode if Tesla fails.  My personal feeling is that the Robotaxi launch combined with a terrible quarterly report sometime in July will push TSLA down to the 200 range and TSLQ up 100% or more from current values.  I am not a professional or giving advice though, just my personal feelings.",2025-06-11T08:44:11,352
stocks,What is up with Iovance Biotherapeutics?,"A week or two ago there was a post here that recommended Iovance as a strong buy.  I went and did a little (obviously way too little) research on it and became convinced of the logic:  The company has a product of great potential, but investors are afraid of a too-slow-roll-out compared to what was expected, meaning a much slower and lower growth than promised. Mainly for this reason, the price had slumped to an all time low, making it an attractive investment to anyone (and I am very much in that camp) looking to diversify into some medical stocks.  So seeing nothing else and all the analysts agreeing that the target price was still high, just further in the future, I bought some shares.  Now I see a class action lawsuit pop up against them for actively lying to their investors and - even more confusingly - the stock continues to rise.   If it had dropped and I had just made a mistake with my purchase, not checking the risks enough, then fair enough, it happens. But what confuses me now is why Iovance is still rising so strongly on this news.  So my question here is: Does anyone who knows about this stock have a good explanation for what is going on with it? Am I looking at a dead cat bounce of a misjudged purchase, or is the news just irrelevant compared to the stocks value?

Here‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs interesting:  * Profit margins today: 1‚Äì2% * Pre-COVID: 10‚Äì15% * Revenue is now higher than pre-COVID * Tons of cash, very little debt * Still one of the best-run airlines, in my opinion  If they get back to 9‚Äì11% margins, the stock could be worth several times what it‚Äôs trading for today. It‚Äôs not exciting, but that‚Äôs the point. Boring companies that generate cash and stay consistent often deliver the best long-term results. The airline industry is tough, no doubt. But if any company can navigate it well, it‚Äôs probably Southwest.",2025-06-11T04:52:09,0
stocks,Google offers buyouts to employees across the company. This trend has started in China and will extend to the western hemisphere,"Edit: Again, not saying that it actually started in China, but highlighting that everything is accelerating with AI systems which will define more optimal avenues for efficiency when it comes to workforce and for now some western hemisphere countries were relatively more protected given our labour laws and social safety nets. But with less employees, less savings for retirement or jobless earnings. Many topics /idea mixed below ( that‚Äôs the beauty of human brain/rambling vs edited by AI).  https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/11/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-ai-hits-an-already-weak-jobs-market.html  https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/google-buyouts-search-ads-unit.html  This trend is likely to accelerate within the next 24 months in Usa. With major cuts expected in the NYSE AI listed companies, significant profits can be made. AI teams will be affected too. A tale of a snake eating its own tail and flesh.  But with the size of the China workforce in a country that produces more than one million engineers yearly, and with the expected rise of unemployment and accelerating AI mechanics , we might be at the dawn of a geopolitical shift in china and a redefinition of the power imbalance between low cost production countries and emerging low cost production countries in all continents.  Jobs average lifespan for employees getting lower and lower. From lifetime jobs more than 60 years ago to 1 month lifespan very soon.  For the hard or brick and mortar stuff, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised in the near future, if technologies companies which typically don‚Äôt pay dividends on consistent basis morph into  structures like REITs ( Real Estate Investment Trusts) and become REITs( Robots Ecosystems Industrial Trusts). You buy a stock of a company owning robots and the entity will pay you monthly dividends; but instead of a bond like return growing slowly, Dividends increase on yearly basis will be more substantial given AI efficiencies.

stocks,"Trump tariffs may remain in effect while appeals proceed, U.S. Appeals court decides","No paywall: [https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-tariffs-may-remain-effect-002514352.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-tariffs-may-remain-effect-002514352.html)  (Reuters) -A federal appeals court allowed President Donald Trump's most sweeping tariffs to remain in effect on Tuesday while it reviews a lower court decision blocking them on grounds that Trump had exceeded his authority by imposing them.  The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. means Trump may continue to enforce, for now, his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on imports from most U.S. trading partners, as well as a separate set of tariffs levied on Canada, China and Mexico.  The appeals court has yet to rule on whether the tariffs are permissible under an emergency economic powers act that Trump cited to justify them, but it allowed the tariffs to remain in place while the appeals play out.  The tariffs, used by Trump as negotiating leverage with U.S. trading partners, and their on-again, off-again nature have shocked markets and whipsawed companies of all sizes as they seek to manage supply chains, production, staffing and prices.  The ruling has no impact on other tariffs levied under more traditional legal authority, such as tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.  A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled on May 28 that the U.S. Constitution gave Congress, not the president, the power to levy taxes and tariffs, and that the president had exceeded his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law intended to address ""unusual and extraordinary"" threats during national emergencies.  The Trump administration quickly appealed the ruling, and the Federal Circuit in Washington put the lower court decision on hold the next day while it considered whether to impose a longer-term pause.  The ruling came in a pair of lawsuits, one filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small U.S. businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties and the other by 12 U.S. states.  Trump has claimed broad authority to set tariffs under IEEPA. The 1977 law has historically been used to impose sanctions on enemies of the U.S. or freeze their assets. Trump is the first U.S. president to use it to impose tariffs.  Trump has said that the tariffs imposed in February on Canada, China and Mexico were to fight illegal fentanyl trafficking at U.S. borders, denied by the three countries, and that the across-the-board tariffs on all U.S. trading partners imposed in April were a response to the U.S. trade deficit.  The states and small businesses had argued the tariffs were not a legal or appropriate way to address those matters, and the small businesses argued that the decades-long U.S. practice of buying more goods than it exports does not qualify as an emergency that would trigger IEEPA.  At least five other court cases have challenged the tariffs justified under the emergency economic powers act, including other small businesses and the state of California. One of those cases, in federal court in Washington, D.C., also resulted in an initial ruling against the tariffs, and no court has yet backed the unlimited emergency tariff authority Trump has claimed.",2025-06-11T00:32:45,249

The company generated NT$320.5 billion ($10.7 billion) in revenue last month. While this marks a strong annual increase, it's an 8.3% decline from April, when TSMC saw a sharper 48.1% year-over-year gain.

Looking ahead, analysts project a 50.3% Y/Y increase in TSMC's second-quarter sales, signaling continued robust demand despite month-over-month volatility.  TSMC chief executive and Chairman C.C.

stocks,Will robots be the next smartphone?,"Tesla appears to be undervalued given its potential to revolutionize the field of robotics for both business and personal use. Stock prices on Wall Street are based on expectations for the future; we must consider what the robotics world will soon look like.Robots have become an integral part of the automotive and semiconductor industries, but mass-produced autonomous robots could have a significant impact on society and Tesla stock.Despite personal concerns, the arrival of advanced robots seems inevitable and it is worth considering future investment opportunities.   Will Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) robots be the next smartphone device for the mass market? Will they have the same impact on society as smartphones? In this article, we'll look at the robots Tesla is developing and whether we can profit from this potential shift.  To some extent, Wall Street bases its judgment on future profit expectations for stock prices. When we think about future prospects, we have to think about what the world will look like in 3, 5, or 10 years and what will happen to stock prices? This is obviously a very difficult question to answer, but we can make reasonable predictions about the overall growth of the emerging humanoid robotics industry.  Ignoring the risks posed by AI and robots to the survival of the species, we can probably assume that the short-term risk is that China will continue to dominate Chinese EV sales, and that Tesla could face a very tough time in the Chinese market. However, global sales of electric vehicles continue to grow. However, as EVs continue to grow, Tesla will need something to differentiate itself, and that's where self-driving cars might come into play. I guess we'll see if that will fully materialize, and for now, it looks like advanced testing will take place in Austin, Texas. Let's move on to the next issue.  China has a monopoly on rare earth elements used in Tesla robots and electric cars. The U.S. government needs to break that monopoly by heavily funding domestic resources. According to Reuters, President Trump may be on the verge of passing the Defense Production Act to fund critical and rare earth elements. Of course, we are currently in the midst of various political waves that are clashing between Elon and President Trump. Trying to predict what will happen between the two of them is futile as they are both unknowns, but it's just something to be aware of. Another risk factor is that Tesla currently has a lot of production in China. If relations with the U.S. deteriorate further, there could be repercussions. That's an unknown to keep an eye on.  I think Tesla Robotics as well as solutions from NVIDIA, Amazon and China are on their way and will materialize in the next few years. Regarding the potential market size, according to a Reuters article, NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said, The age of robotics has arrived. People are paying attention. This is likely to be the biggest industry.    So will humanoid robots become as popular as smartphones? I think it's possible, and if we look at how Elon is transforming Optimus Prime in the factory, we'll have a clearer picture of the future in a few years.",2025-06-10T14:45:48,0
stocks,Could OpenAI use Google Cloud? What does this mean for GOOG stocks?,"Hey guys just read the news about goog that OpenAI is in talks with Google Cloud to possibly migrate some of its AI training loads from Microsoft Azure If true, what will this do to the stock of Google's parent company Alphabet (GOOG)?  Let's start with the reasons why OpenAI might be moving to Google Cloud:  I think it might be to avoid vendor lock-in: OpenAI doesn't want to be tied to Microsoft Azure alone, especially if Microsoft's supply of arithmetic power can't keep up with demand    Competitive pricing: Google Cloud may offer more competitive pricing on TPU/GPU resources, especially since training large models is extremely costly  Technology differentiation: Google's TPU v5e and Vertex AI may be more efficient than Azure for certain AI tasks  What would be the benefits to Google if they did move to Google Cloud?  Cloud business growth: if OpenAI does migrate some of its loads, Google Cloud revenues will directly benefit AI-related demand could accelerate  AI ecosystem strengthening: we all know that Google has already invested in Anthropic (ChatGPT competitor) adding OpenAI would further strengthen its AI infrastructure position   Sentiment Boost: Investors have been worried that Google is falling behind Microsoft in the AI race, and this deal could ease that anxiety and boost the stock price.  The favorable impacts of the above are indeed many but there are still many potential factors:  We need to understand that Microsoft is still the biggest owner of OpenAI: it has invested tens of billions of dollars, and it has first right of refusal to commercialize OpenAI technology.69 Even if it uses the Google Cloud, Microsoft will still be able to take a cut of OpenAI's revenue.  Regulatory risk: If OpenAI and Google get too close, the antitrust agency could get involved.  How will the market react?  Short term: If the news is confirmed, GOOG may jump 3-5%.  Long-term: It's critical to see if Google can use OpenAI to close the AI gap with Azure Currently, Microsoft is earning a lot of eyeballs by integrating Bing/Office with ChatGPT Google is in dire need of the same level of AI use cases  Guys what do you think, will GOOG take off as a result or will Microsoft remain on the AI throne?",2025-06-10T14:36:14,157

And because everyone has different ideas on how a comapny should be valued, does that mean there is no way to accurately pick good for value stocks? because if no one can agree on what metrics to look at then maybe its because nobody could figure out accurate models at picking good for value stocks?  Or when they did find the holy grail of metrics to look at, everyone else did the same so then it ended up cancelling itself when everyone is investing in same companies??  I feel like if there truly were specific metrics that could accurately predict or forecast a target price of a stock then wed all be using them right now wouldnt we??  Surely someone would have back-tested using various metrics to forecast stock prices by now using machine learning and algorithms??",2025-06-10T11:46:44,0
stocks,Baird Downgrades Tesla Over Musk‚Äôs ‚ÄòToo Optimistic‚Äô Robotaxi Comments: Retail Sees No Reason To be Optimistic,"The stock's strong performance following a ""fundamentally poor quarter"" has been partly due to anticipation for the June launch of both a more affordable vehicle and robotaxi service, the analyst told investors.  Baird on Monday downgraded Tesla Inc. (TSLA) shares to ‚ÄòNeutral‚Äô from ‚ÄòOutperform‚Äô with an unchanged price target of $320. The EV-maker‚Äôs stock traded 2% lower in Monday‚Äôs pre-market session.  The stock's strong performance following a ""fundamentally poor quarter"" has been partly due to anticipation for the June launch of both a more affordable vehicle and robotaxi service, the analyst told investors in a note, as per TheFly.  However, Baird believes Tesla CEO Elon Musk's comments regarding the robotaxi ramp rate ""are a bit too optimistic,"" and that this excitement has been priced into shares. The firm also noted that Musk's ties to President Trump, which soured last week following a war of words, ""have added considerable uncertainty.""  However, Baird sees Tesla as a core holding in the long term. The $320 price target also implies an 8% upside to the company‚Äôs closing price on Friday.  Musk has been looking to shift Tesla‚Äôs image from an automaker to an artificial intelligence and robotics company with self-driving robotaxis and humanoid robots called Optimus.  While the pilot launch of robotaxis is expected this week in Austin, Texas, the company is looking to build Optimus on its pilot production line at the Fremont factory this year.  As interest in robotics and AI-integrated mobility accelerates, stocks like $GM, $F, $NVDA, $BGM, and $QCOM could benefit from broader adoption trends, particularly around autonomous systems and next-gen automation platforms.  However, Tesla‚Äôs lead executive for its Optimus humanoid robot program, Milan Kovac, left the company on personal grounds last week.  Kovac, who joined Tesla in 2016, said in an X post on Friday that he will be moving out of his position as a vice president of engineering.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been far away from home for too long, and will need to spend more time with family abroad,‚Äù he wrote while also terming it ‚Äúthe most difficult decision‚Äù of his life.  Kovac also clarified that the decision has nothing to do with anything else.  ‚ÄúMy support for Elon Musk and the team is ironclad - Tesla team forever,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúElon, you‚Äôve taught me to discern signal from noise, hardcore resilience, and many fundamental principles of engineering. I am forever grateful. Tesla will win, I guarantee you that.‚Äù  Kovac also opined that his exit will not delay the Optimus project, which he took over in 2022.  In April, Musk said that Tesla will initially deploy a small fleet of its Model Y vehicles in June as part of the robotaxi pilot launch in Austin. The CEO also stated that he sees Tesla operating robotaxis in many other U.S. cities by the end of the year.  Musk also stated that the company anticipates having thousands of Optimus robots operating at its factories by year-end.",2025-06-10T11:40:31,123

Zuckerberg has prioritized recruiting for the secretive new team, referred to internally as a superintelligence group, according to people familiar with his plans. He has an audacious goal in mind, these people said. In his view, Meta can and should outstrip other tech companies in achieving what‚Äôs known as artificial general intelligence or AGI, the notion that machines can perform as well as humans at many tasks. Once Meta reaches that milestone, it could weave the capability into its suite of products ‚Äî not just social media and communications platforms, but also a range of AI tools, including the Meta chatbot and its AI-powered Ray-Ban glasses.  Zuckerberg aims to hire around 50 people for the new team, including a new head of AI research, almost all of whom he‚Äôs recruiting personally. He‚Äôs rearranged desks at the company‚Äôs Menlo Park headquarters so the new staff will sit near him, the people said, asking to remain anonymous discussing private plans.   Zuckerberg is building that team in tandem with a planned multi-billion dollar investment in Scale AI, which offers data services to help companies train their models. Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang is expected to join the superintelligence group after a deal is done. Bloomberg News first reported on the deal, set to become Meta‚Äôs largest external investment to date. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.  Zuckerberg has spoken openly about making artificial intelligence a priority for his company. In the last two months, he‚Äôs gone into ‚Äúfounder mode,‚Äù according to people familiar with his work, who described an increasingly hands-on management style.   https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-10/zuckerberg-recruits-new-superintelligence-ai-group-at-meta",2025-06-10T07:05:15,920

WBD‚Äôs roots trace back to the troubled AOL-Time Warner merger in 2001, once touted as the future of digital media but soon undone by culture clashes and the dot-com crash. AOL was spun off in 2009, and Time Warner eventually merged with AT&T in 2018, a deal reversed in 2021 when WarnerMedia joined with Discovery.

stocks,Intuitive Surgical $ISRG ($526.98) Downgraded by Deutsche Bank. My Take,"Deutsche Bank downgraded ISRG mostly because of valuation. ISRG dumped hard after the rerating. Down \~6.6%.   The company itself is doing pretty good. It is a leader in robotic surgery. Their da Vinci platform is the most widely used surgical robot globally. They just launched da Vinci 5 this year. It has new features, good AI tools, even performance analytics for surgeons.  Fundamentals haven't changed. They have high margins and are having double digit growth. Their recurring revenue is pretty solid. They have zero debt and a massive cash pile.  This crash wasn‚Äôt about business. It was a valuation flush. The main concern was competition churning out cheaper alternatives which could affect ISRG in the future. This could just be an overreaction and speculation. ISRG is the category leader and their business is doing really well and they are deeply entrenched within the hospital systems and they have regulatory protections as well. Switching won't be that easy for the competition.   Right now, there is a good chance ISRG could in the short term revert to $540+ zone from the current price if the support holds. But if $498 breaks with force, next stop might be $475 (gap-fill area from March). Again, this is a short term play.  Historically, ISRG usually bounces after these downgrade/panic moves. If you believe in the company, this could be a decent spot to start watching or scaling in.   **Not financial advice.**",2025-06-09T18:56:13,18

stocks,Warner Bros. Discovery to split into two public companies by next year,"Warner Bros. Discovery¬†plans to split into two public companies by next year, the media giant announced Monday, the latest upheaval in the industry as consumers transition from cable to streaming.  WBD will separate into a streaming and studios company, which will include its movie properties and streaming service HBO Max, and a global networks company, which will include CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery, among other businesses.  CEO David Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company. Current CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will become CEO of the global networks business.  Warner Bros. Discovery expects to complete the split by the middle of 2026.  ‚ÄúBy operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today‚Äôs evolving media landscape,‚Äù Zaslav said in a¬†release.  The news confirms earlier reporting by CNBC and others that WBD was considering such a split. In December, the company¬†announced restructuring¬†that many saw as a precursor to a full break.  It also comes as cable giant¬†Comcast¬†is in the process of¬†spinning out its portfolio of cable networks, including CNBC, into a new publicly traded company¬†called Versant. That separation, announced last year, inspired speculation that the media industry could soon see¬†heightened consolidation.  Warner Bros.

stocks,Robinhood shares drop after the online brokerage fails to get the nod to join the S&P 500,"Robinhood¬†shares sold off on Monday as the online brokerage was snubbed in the latest quarterly rebalance of the¬†S&P 500¬†after months of speculation that it could earn a coveted spot in the benchmark.  Shares of Robinhood dropped more than 3% in premarket trading. The stock rallied 3.3% on Friday to bring last week‚Äôs gain to more than 13% before S&P Dow Jones Indices said after the bell that the S&P 500 would remain unchanged.  Just last week,¬†Bank of America called Robinhood a top candidate¬†to join the S&P 500 during the big reshuffling in June. The S&P 500 rebalance, which typically comes on the third Friday of the last month in a quarter, is usually an impactful event as it can spark billions of dollars of trading and spur passive funds to snap up its shares. Companies being added to the index can generally expect funds like that to buy huge amounts of their shares in the coming weeks.  Crypto exchange¬†Coinbase¬†was the latest beneficiary of such an inclusion. The stock skyrocketed 24% in the next trading session following the announcement last month.

stocks,China wants Slimmer Pigs,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-wants-slimmer-pigs-033538256.html   China‚Äôs crackdown on the speculative hog ‚Äúrefattening‚Äù practice, where small farmers buy adult pigs from larger producers and fatten them further in hopes of higher prices has implications for several NYSE-listed companies, especially those in agriculture, feed, and pork exports. The government aims to reduce market volatility, preserve feed efficiency, and lower grain use as part of its broader goal to cut reliance on U.S. agricultural imports amid an ongoing trade war.  Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and Bunge Limited (BG), both major exporters of soybeans and feed grains, may be negatively impacted if China reduces demand for imported animal feed. Lower grain consumption for refattening could mean fewer soybean exports from the U.S., especially since soy is a key ingredient in livestock feed. Companies like Ingredion (INGR), involved in feed additives and agricultural inputs, could also see softened demand if China tightens feed regulations.  Pork producers such as Tyson Foods (TSN) and Hormel Foods (HRL) could be affected in different ways. If the crackdown leads to reduced pork supply in China, it may increase demand for imported pork, benefiting U.S. suppliers. However, if pork prices in China remain weak due to oversupply, U.S. exporters might face pricing pressures.  CME Group (CME), which facilitates grain and livestock futures trading, may benefit from increased price volatility and trading activity triggered by these policy changes.  In short, while grain exporters may face headwinds, meat processors and exchanges could see mixed to positive effects depending on how China‚Äôs policies reshape domestic supply and import demand.",2025-06-09T08:30:16,58

stocks,LONG $CROX -,"**$CROX. My thesis is quite simple: Crocs is profoundly undervalued by the market, especially when compared to its peers. The underlying fundamentals show a company which generates significant free cash flow, aggressively pays down debt, and is opportunistically buying back shares. The company displays numerous positive indicators which will lead to immense shareholder value.**  I'm long $CROX. Here‚Äôs a few reasons why.¬†  One of the common misconceptions about Crocs is that it's just a temporary fad. However, a closer look at its history and current market position reveals something far more substantial. While initially perceived as a novelty, Crocs has effectively evolved from a niche boating shoe into a global phenomenon, establishing a surprisingly durable brand and a significant moat.  What's their moat? It's simple: they've created a category of their own. There's nothing quite like a Croc. Their proprietary Croslite‚Ñ¢ material, distinctive design, and unparalleled comfort offer a unique value proposition that is incredibly difficult for competitors to replicate directly without appearing to be a mere imitation. This isn't just about patents; it's about deeply ingrained brand recognition and a loyal customer base that embraces the aesthetic and the pure functionality. They've also cleverly leveraged collaborations and Jibbitz‚Ñ¢ charms to foster personalization and cultural relevance, further solidifying their unique identity.  Crocs has proven its longevity through multiple economic cycles and shifts in fashion, demonstrating resilience and adaptability. Their stores are often bustling, and critically, their e-commerce (Direct-to-Consumer or DTC) side of the business is performing exceptionally well. This direct connection with consumers allows for higher margins and valuable insights into customer preferences, further strengthening their market position. In recent quarters, DTC revenues for the Crocs brand have shown consistent growth, proving the strength of their online presence and customer engagement.  **The Valuation Discrepancy: CROX vs. Industry Comps**  This is where the rubber meets the road. I believe the market is mispricing Crocs, and the numbers illustrate a stark contrast when we look at Price/Free Cash Flow (P/FCF).  Here are some key metrics based on current data (FY2024 for FCF and Market Cap as of 6/08/25):  **Crocs ($CROX):**  Market Cap: $5.69 billion  Revenue (2024): $4.1 billion  FCF (2024): $923 million¬†  P/FCF: 6.16x  FCF Margin: 22.5%  Now, let's compare this to two industry peers.  **Deckers Outdoor ($DECK - UGG, Hoka):**  Market Cap: $16.32 billion  Revenue (2024): $4.99 billion  FCF (2024): $958 million  P/FCF: 17.03x  FCF Margin: 19.2%  **Skechers ($SKX):**  Market Cap: $9.29 billion  Revenue (2024): $8.97 billion  Annual FCF (2024): $271 million  P/FCF: 34.28x  FCF Margin: 3.02%  The P/FCF for Crocs is significantly lower than both Deckers and Skechers, despite Crocs demonstrating a FCF margin that is comparable to Deckers' and vastly superior to Skechers'.¬†**This wide disparity suggests that the market is either drastically underestimating Crocs' ability to generate and sustain its impressive free cash flow or is overvaluing its peers, or a combination of both.**¬†  **Management's Shareholder-Friendly Capital Allocation:**  Beyond the attractive valuation metrics, management's capital allocation strategy further strengthens the bull case:  Following the Hey Dude acquisition, Crocs took on substantial debt. However, management has been laser-focused on deleveraging. They've consistently communicated their commitment to¬†**using free cash flow to pay down debt.**¬†This disciplined approach reduces financial risk and will eventually lead to higher earnings for shareholders. In 2024 alone,¬†**they paid down approximately $320 million of debt.**  Crocs has a robust share repurchase program in place. Management views the stock as undervalued and has been¬†**actively buying back shares.**¬†In Q1 2025, Crocs repurchased approximately 0.6 million shares for $61 million at an average share price of $100.23. This information was released in their earnings report around May 8, 2025. Additionally, Crocs¬†**upsized their authorization by $1 billion,**¬†bringing the total authorization to approximately $1.3 billion. This is a¬†**highly effective way to return value to shareholders when the stock is trading below its intrinsic value,**¬†as it reduces the share count and boosts EPS.  Long term, I believe the value realization is inevitable.  **My entire thesis hinges on the belief that the market is currently overlooking the immense value proposition of Crocs.**¬†  Bringing it all together, Crocs stands as a durable brand that has transcended ""fad"" status, establishing a unique moat,¬†**generating massive free cash flow with an excellent margins,**¬†deleveraging responsibly,¬†**returning capital to shareholders through aggressive share repurchases, and continuing to grow its top and bottom line with strong DTC and international performance.**¬†These factors lead me to believe investors will eventually realize this disconnect and re-rate the stock to align with its intrinsic value, making it a compelling fundamental value investment in a strong, cash-generative business.",2025-06-08T22:48:37,49
stocks,DocuSign $DOCU ($75.28) -19% Sudden Crash and the IAM Story (IAM Analysis),"DocuSign's core offering is pretty simple. It is an e-signature company. Google Docs, Adobe Sign are pretty much offering the same thing and they have enterprise offerings too.  Well, that changed about a year back. DocuSign is transitioning to the next phase. Into *Intelligent Agreement Management* (IAM).  DocuSign IAM became the fastest growing product in the company's history. More than 10,000 customers have adopted IAM. They processed tens of millions of agreements.  So, what is IAM exactly and what problem does it solve?  Corporations are facing ""Agreement Trap"". Nearly $2 trillion in global economic value is lost annually due to poor agreement management. Most companies are stuck managing contracts with Word docs, email chains, and file folders. Important contract info gets lost, renewals are missed, and everything takes forever.  IAM reads your contracts and pulls out key info (dates, dollar amounts, terms), sends renewal reminders, gives you insights on your contract portfolio. This is an AI powered solution and they are using AI contract agents¬†to help with this.  Companies are seeing 70% faster onboarding, millions in cost savings, and 75% efficiency boosts.  It's their big bet on becoming more than just the ""e-signature company"". They want to own the entire contract lifecycle.  They are seeing early success:  * KPC Private Funds saw customer onboarding time savings of 70%. * Velatura identified an estimated $82M in annual cost savings * Catchafire doubled contracting capacity across their sales and legal teams. * Metro Credit Union boosted operational efficiency by 75% in the first 4 weeks of using IAM.  Despite this progress, the stock crashed 19% after June earnings on billing guidance concerns. This could be market overreaction creating opportunity. Two days before earnings, someone bet $71,000 that $DOCU would crash below $80 within 48 hours. They were right and made a lot of money! This suggests that the selling pressure was from informed players who are now likely done.  Right now, if $75 holds, price is likely to revert toward $84 as panic cools. Watch for early reversal signs, especially into Monday‚Äôs open. But if it drops to $72 it could go down even lower. Again, this is for a short term play.  **Not Financial Advice.

stocks,"25M Learnig finances, is my plan any good for a 5 or 10 years?","I'm currently building a long-term investment portfolio with around $15,500 in USD. My approach is to combine strong exposure to tech and innovation with some international diversification. I've selected individual stocks like NVIDIA(15%) and AMD(10%) to capture growth in the AI and semiconductor space, and I've included TSLA(10%) as a way to gain exposure to the EV and energy transition sectors‚Äîthough I'm open to switching that position for aerospace and defense in the future, depending on market conditions.  To complement those, I'm using the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (15%) for broader exposure to leading U.S. tech companies. I've also added the Franklin FTSE India ETF (10%) to capture long-term growth potential in emerging markets, particularly India. In addition, I've chosen a cybersecurity ETF (RIZE CYBR) (10%) to position myself in a sector that's increasingly critical, and I‚Äôve added a biotech ETF along with Moderna(15%)to diversify into healthcare innovation.  Besides this USD portfolio, I hold 10,000 euros in the Vanguard Global Stock Index Fund. I plan to add 75 euros monthly to this fund, while saving another 75 euros each month as cash on the side, to take advantage of opportunities within my main portfolio or strengthen existing positions when there are dips.  Lastly, I‚Äôm keeping around 35,000 euros in cash, which I plan to hold in a high-interest savings account or similar low-risk vehicle, with full liquidity in case I decide to make a property purchase in the near future.  This mix allows me to stay invested in sectors I believe in, while maintaining flexibility and liquidity for both opportunities and personal needs. Open to thoughts or suggestions on how to improve it.  \*Edit:   My current main questions:  1. Can all this markets go up during 4 and a half years but suddenly on the 5th year go down? What's the point then holding long term?   2. The longer you hold, the less a ""break down"" can affect your portfolio? For example: A general 40% down will make you lose money on year 5 but you will be ""strong enough"" at year 10 to still being positive eventhough the breakdown?   3. I know ""time in the market > timing in the market"" but do you think it is a good week/month to enter? Nvidia for example is super high right now.   4. If you hold for 10 years, but there's a big loss on year 10. Does that mean all those 9 years have been useless and you gotta start again?      Sorry if the questions are too noob and thankyou for the feedback.",2025-06-08T19:32:31,7

Apple's¬†annual Worldwide Developers Conference¬†opens the week with a keynote session from CEO Tim Cook scheduled for Monday.

stocks,"The case for $AMD, part 2.","In AI, training and inference are two distinct phases of how models learn and operate:  1. Training (Learning Phase) AI models learn patterns from large datasets.  Requires massive computing power‚Äîthink NVIDIA GPUs running complex computations.  Happens once per model (with occasional retraining as needed).  Think of it like school‚Äîthe model absorbs knowledge but doesn‚Äôt yet apply it.  2. Inference (Execution Phase) AI applies its training to make predictions or generate responses in real time.  Uses less compute power than training but happens billions of times daily across devices.  This is where models generate revenue‚Äîchatbots, AI assistants, and smart applications all run inference.  Think of it like a trained employee doing their job‚Äîthey already learned the skills, now they execute.

stocks,Title: JDE Peet‚Äôs (JDEP.AS) quietly shaping up to be one of the best value plays in Europe,"I've been digging into JDE Peet‚Äôs (JDEP.AS) lately, and honestly, the more I look, the more it feels like one of those classic value cases hiding in plain sight. For those who don‚Äôt know it: JDE Peet‚Äôs is the largest pure-play coffee and tea company in the world, with brands like Douwe Egberts, L‚ÄôOR, Jacobs, and Senseo. They operate in over 100 countries, have serious scale, and yet the stock is flying completely under the radar.  What really caught my attention is their ‚Ç¨250 million share buyback, not just the size of it, but the fact that they almost paused it recently because the share price was rising too quickly. That‚Äôs not something you hear every day. When management pulls back on a buyback program because they think the stock is getting too expensive too fast, it tells you they believe intrinsic value is well above current levels. It‚Äôs like a soft floor under the stock, set by the company itself.  Then there‚Äôs pricing power. Most consumer goods companies have been struggling with inflation, but JDE Peet‚Äôs seems to be holding margins far better than peers. They‚Äôve been able to push through price increases without major volume losses and in some cases, retailers are the ones absorbing the increases just to keep these brands on the shelves (Dutch retailers like Albert Heijn).That says a lot about the strength of their portfolio and their negotiating power in the value chain.  Fundamentally, this is a cash machine. Free cash flow keeps growing year over year. They run lean operations, keep capex in check, and deploy their cash well: dividends, deleveraging, and share repurchases. The FCF yield is in the 8‚Äì10% range, which is exceptional for a consumer staple with this level of global reach. And yet, the stock is still trading below its IPO price of ‚Ç¨31.50 a level that was already considered cautious when they went public in 2020.  Now here‚Äôs where it gets even more interesting: JAB Holding. They own the majority of JDE Peet‚Äôs and recently bought out Mondelez‚Äôs 26.5% stake. At the same time, they freed up cash by selling part of their Keurig Dr Pepper stake. Put those together: the increased control, the available capital, and the deeply undervalued share price and it starts to look like a textbook setup for a take-private scenario. JAB has done this before with other consumer brands, and the conditions look right for it to happen again.  So you‚Äôve got a company with strong fundamentals, pricing power, high and growing free cash flow, aggressive buybacks, and a majority owner who‚Äôs consolidating control ‚Äî all while the market barely notices. It feels like the downside is limited, and the upside could come either from a re-rating or a strategic move like a buyout.  32% of my portfolio is allocated into this stock and I have also written some puts with a strike price of ‚Ç¨22 when the price was ‚Ç¨18,50. cost average is 18,48 per share.",2025-06-08T09:58:36,0
stocks,How can I figure out my cost basis?,"Last time I posted this question, it was deleted because it 'tends to lead to spam replies'.   The time before that, some people suggested some websites, but I have not been able to get any of them to work. I'm either getting values that are 30x higher than they should be or 20x smaller than they should be.  Long story short, I have a stock position thats 25 years old. I've bought and sold and reinvested dividends many times over the years. Schwab deleted 15 years of TDAmeritrade transaction history when they bought them. But I was able to rebuild my transaction history based on an 11 year old spreadsheet I found.   I went through and corrected all values for the splits, so now I have all my transactions going back to 2001.

stocks,"Earnings up, yields up   is Trump‚Äôs $3T bill a bull trap in disguise?","Everyone‚Äôs watching the Musk vs. Trump drama like it‚Äôs the main event, but markets should probably be paying more attention to what‚Äôs actually in Trump‚Äôs $3T ‚Äúbig beautiful bill‚Äù  because it‚Äôs very much alive and moving forward  Despite Musk calling out GOP lawmakers, threatening primaries, and warning about the deficit (which, by the way, multiple analyses say will balloon by $2.4T+), the bill‚Äôs still on track. Thune and Senate leadership basically shrugged him off. They‚Äôre pushing this thing through  and fast  Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting from a market angle:  They're talking about cutting back the $40K SALT deduction to save money. But whatever they save might immediately get canceled out because there's also strong pressure to make temporary business tax breaks permanent  stuff like R&D deductions, bonus depreciation, and interest expensing  That‚Äôs a huge deal if you're long big-cap tech, industrials, or healthcare. These tax breaks boost reported earnings pretty directly. If they go permanent, EPS estimates probably move higher without companies having to do anything operationally. Think MSFT, LMT, UNH  names like that  But here‚Äôs the tradeoff: the bill‚Äôs already inflationary. If they don‚Äôt pay for it, bond yields are going to feel it. So while stocks might get an earnings tailwind, valuations could stay capped or even compress further if the 10Y starts creeping above 5% again  And the AI provision buried in the bill? Wild. Originally it said states couldn‚Äôt regulate AI for 10 years ‚Äî a total federal preemption. Now they‚Äôre walking that back to a softer ‚Äúyou lose broadband funding if you pass certain laws‚Äù version. Doesn‚Äôt matter much fiscally, but for megacaps like NVDA and GOOG, this is one less regulatory headache. The moat just got a little deeper  One curveball that could raise the cost: Section 899. It lets the president slap taxes on foreign countries seen as ""discriminatory."" Some senators want to remove it, which could limit future revenue and geopolitical leverage. Not a today problem, but if you're watching defense and energy stocks tied to foreign trade, it matters  And now there's infighting about Medicaid cuts. Josh Hawley‚Äôs out here writing NYT op-eds saying this bill punishes working-class voters while handing corporate tax cuts. He‚Äôs not totally wrong. If the GOP starts shifting back toward economic populism, how long do these business-friendly tax policies actually last?  So here‚Äôs the real market question buried in all this: Are we about to get an earnings boost that the bond market completely wipes out?Because if you‚Äôre buying the earnings upgrade but ignoring the debt story  you might be trading the right trend with the wrong multiple",2025-06-07T21:40:08,902

stocks,My Thesis on TSLA ($295.14) and CRWV ($140.16),"***This is a multi-signal analysis***, built by synthesizing options flow data, sentiment, company fundamentals, and technical structure. I'm focusing on setups where multiple signals converge. Not just one off price moves or just pure TA.  We all know about the Elon Musk vs. Trump drama that's playing out in public. On June 5, $TSLA dropped nearly 14% in a single session. That was its largest one day drop since March 2020.  This wasn‚Äôt a move based on earnings or fundamentals. It was event driven and sentiment driven. And it came with record put volume. There were over 4 million contracts traded. This is pointing to either panic hedging or high conviction short bets. That kind of volume typically leads to short term dislocation.  On June 6, TSLA rebounded +3.7%, showing early signs of stabilization. That bounce came on strong volume, which adds weight to the reversion thesis.  **Entry Zone:**   $285‚Äì$288 is a key support zone. A clean hold or reclaim above $300 with volume reactivates the bounce thesis.  **Target Zone:**   $305‚Äì$318, especially if the political overhang fades and sentiment resets.  **Danger Zone:**   Avoid entries if price retests below $280 without reversal. This could lead to further downside.  Now looking at CoreWeave ($CRWV):  CRWV IPO‚Äôd in March and ran from \~$57 (May 13) to \~$163 by June 4. This was a 185% move in just three weeks. That‚Äôs a classic parabolic extension.  It pulled back on June 5 to \~$135 and closed June 6 at $140.16. So far, this looks more like the first real cooling off period than a full reversal.  Options flow is mixed. There's still aggressive call activity at $150‚Äì$160, but we‚Äôre also seeing increasing open interest in the $130 and $120 puts. That split usually signals uncertainty. Some still chasing upside, others starting to hedge or fade.  **Entry Zone:**   Watching $130‚Äì$134. That was prior resistance and could act as support if price compresses there. If it reclaims $145 with strength, the setup for a retest of the highs becomes viable.  **Target Zone:**   $155‚Äì$160, but only if price gets back above $145 on volume.  **Danger Zone:**   A breakdown below $125 likely triggers a deeper unwind. Watching $114‚Äì$118 as the next volume shelf.  **Conclusion:**   TSLA looks like a higher confidence reversion setup. The size of the flush, the record flow, and the bounce all point to a dislocation that can snap back. CRWV is more speculative. It's a momentum name cooling off after a vertical run. It's tradable, but only with confirmation.  Would love to hear how others are approaching these. Especially if you‚Äôre tracking the same flows or setups.  ***Not financial advice***",2025-06-07T15:03:11,0
stocks,"Federal Reserve lifts $1.95 Trillion asset cap on Wells Fargo, after seven years","After 7 years, Wells Fargo is finally able to grow their deposits and make more loans. The Federal Reserve lifted an asset cap that punished Wells Fargo after the bank committed widespread fraud against its own customers ranging from 2002 to 2016. Would you trust Wells Fargo with your hard earned money? Would you even invest in $WFC stock, now that growth is uncapped?  Below are snipets of a Reuter's Article. The link below will take you to view the full story.  ""The Fed imposed the unprecedented restriction in 2018 following years of high-profile missteps at the bank, including a far-ranging scandal in which employees opened millions of unauthorized accounts for customers.  But the Fed said in a statement that the bank had made ""substantial progress"" in addressing its deficiencies, including improving its governance and risk-management programs, and completing a third-party review of its overhaul. The Fed board voted unanimously to lift the restriction, which was the first time the central bank had directly ordered a bank to stop growing in order to address widespread shortcomings.  The decision is a major step in the bank's longstanding efforts to repair the damage from scandals that erupted in 2016, drawing public criticism and billions of dollars in fines.""  https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/fed-lifts-wells-fargos-asset-cap-citing-progress-sales-scandal-2025-06-03/",2025-06-07T15:01:49,921

stocks,My inability to follow my intuition has cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars,"I messed up last year and even when I know the fundamentals of a stock are sound, I don‚Äôt invest.  I‚Äôve built a strong intuition over the years. In the early 2020s, I trusted it and went all in on NVDA with $40k‚Äîand it turned into hundreds of thousands. But then I got cocky. I listened to my brother-in-law (never again), invested in a stock without doing research, and lost $70k. Since then, my confidence has been tainted.  I dedicate myself to rigorous research, spending hours each day on relevant reading. While some may claim I‚Äôve made poor investment choices, that‚Äôs simply not the case. I‚Äôve studied The Intelligent Investor along with several other books recommended by Warren Buffett, treating them like a college curriculum‚Äîcomplete with notecards and in-depth analysis. My investment strategy blends both value and growth principles.  My family have come to know I make good recommendations, so they ask me would I would buy:  * my brother asked so I recommended Palantir at $20. He‚Äôs up 500%. * my friend asked so I recommended Vista & Constellation Energy, and NuScale. All up huge. * my uncle asked so I recommended MicroStrategy at $150.

Trump signed an Executive Order to ensure continued American leadership in the development, commercialization, and export of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)‚Äîotherwise known as drones.  The Order directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to expand drone operations by enabling routine ‚ÄúBeyond Visual Line of Sight‚Äù drone operations for commercial and public safety missions, and to accelerate the development, testing, and scaling of American drone technologies, including advanced air mobility and autonomous operations.  The Order establishes an electric ‚ÄúVertical Takeoff and Landing‚Äù integration pilot program to accelerate the deployment of safe and lawful vertical operations in the United States, selecting at least five pilot projects to advance applications like cargo transport and medical response. It directs the FAA Administrator to deploy artificial intelligence (AI) tools to streamline and expedite UAS waiver reviews.  The Order directs the FAA Administrator to publish an updated roadmap for the integration of civil UAS into the National Airspace System. It strengthens the domestic drone industrial base by prioritizing U.S.-manufactured UAS, promoting their export and taking action to ensure our technology remains secure from undue foreign influence and exploitation.  It enhances global competitiveness by streamlining regulations, expanding market access, and utilizing federal financing tools. The Order supports the warfighter by expanding access to U.S.-manufactured high-performing drones while streamlining airspace and spectrum access.  DRIVING INNOVATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH: President Trump is harnessing the potential of drones to boost American productivity and global leadership. Drones enhance U.S. productivity, create high-skilled jobs, and are reshaping the future of aviation in areas such as logistics, infrastructure inspection, precision agriculture, emergency response, and public safety. Emerging technologies, such as vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, promise to modernize methods for cargo delivery, passenger transport, and other advanced air mobility capabilities.  For too long, unfair foreign competition has posed a national security risk, disincentivizing our drone industrial base. This order is removing regulatory barriers and directing federal agencies to prioritize U.S.-manufactured drones, secure our supply chains, and promote American leadership in production, certification, and export.  ADVANCING DRONE TECHNOLOGIES: President Trump is advancing drone technologies for economic, security, and public safety benefits. In his first term, President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum to speed up commercial drone integration, launching a UAS Integration Pilot Program to test innovative applications with State, local, and tribal partners.    President Trump has deployed UAS to patrol the southern border, strengthening national security through advanced surveillance and monitoring capabilities. President Trump has advanced cutting-edge drone technologies through smart, targeted regulation, unlocking economic growth while strengthening safety, security, and innovation.",2025-06-06T20:57:38,210
stocks,"Peter Navarro said ""Everyone in our first term who said our tariffs were going to be recessionary were wrong""","Most people I see on here are concerned about a recession due to tariffs. Elon tweeted it yesterday too. I forget the exact index which said this, but consumers are more afraid of a recession coming than they were around covid.   American economist and counselor to the president for trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro said:  ""Everyone in our first term who said our tariffs were going to be recessionary and inflationary were obviously wrong. All we got was price stability and growth.  If you understand how gdp is calculated you'll know there's 1) consumption 2) investment 3) government spending and 4) net exports.  And when you have them selling us more than we sell to them, in the math of gdp, growth goes down. So every quarter when those numbers get reported, when you see what the net number is, that number would probably be a point or more higher if we didn't run a trade deficit. So the idea that these tariffs are going to somehow be recessionary is wrong. There's 2 things going on: with the tariffs we make more things here, we employ more people, in the short run. And in the longer run we get more capital investment and produce more goods.""  Does this change your mind about tariffs causing a recession?

In addition, this trade deal could bring forward inflation concerns if the economic impact is stronger than expected  I'm personally looking at **tech** stocks next week If the deal brings positive sentiment I'm expecting a short-term rally in these sectors However I'm also hedging my bets with some **puts** on broader indices in case the deal disappoints and causes volatility  Anyone else planning to make moves based on this Are there any specific stocks you think will get a major bump if the deal is good",2025-06-06T19:34:24,102

Right now I have 2 accounts, a Roth IRA and Personal brokerage (will open a 401(k) once I graduate and can start working).   Both of these I want to just buy and hold. The vast majority of both accounts are made up of VOO (\~85% and \~61% respectively but working to get it to 70%) the rest of each portfolio is made up of some individual blue-chip stocks that are in the technology sector. As ive been doing some research ive realized that I should try and target 70% S&P ETF and 30% Nasdaq ETf (QQQ or QQQM).  My question is this, should take those blue-chip stocks, sell them off and reinvest it into just buying into the ETFs or just leave them be and going forward strictly invest into the ETFs? Any and all help and advice is appreciated! Thank you!",2025-06-06T17:28:34,8
stocks,Swiss Government hits UBS with $26 billion added capital requirement,"The Swiss government is learning from the Credit Suisse mess and now wants UBS to follow stricter capital requirements.  * Swiss government proposes tougher capital rules for UBS post-Credit Suisse takeover * New rules could require additional $26 billion in capital * UBS executives warn bank's competitiveness may suffer * Reforms also aim to strengthen regulator, enhance liquidity access * Shares jump after proposals made public  What‚Äôs interesting is that despite the stricter rules, UBS stock went up.

Before the November 2024 election, we saw impressive job and economic reports, only to find out later that many of them were revised downward.  Anyone familiar with statistics knows how easily numbers can be manipulated.  Here‚Äôs my hot take:  Trump likely sees the real, unfiltered data. He gets internal reports. He knows the storm is coming‚Äîand he‚Äôs nervous.  He‚Äôs trying to make the public numbers look good while quietly taking steps to boost the economy behind the scenes.   Why is he pressuring JPowell to lower the rates when all the media is saying that job data is solid? See the irony there?

What Now for Stocks?,"Another day, another Trump post slamming Jerome Powell  this time calling for a FULL POINT CUT, saying ‚ÄúGo for rocket fuel!‚Äù after the May jobs report dropped. But here‚Äôs the catch: the labor market is still strong. Nonfarm payrolls came in at +139k vs. 126k expected, and unemployment held steady at 4.2%.

stocks,Musk Blinks First in $34B Tesla Meltdown Amid Trump Feud  What‚Äôs Next for $TSLA?,"So... Elon Musk just lost $34 billion in net worth in one trading day after his public feud with President Trump sent $TSLA into free fall (down as much as 18% intraday, closed down \~12%). A record $153B in market cap gone.  This all started when Musk began trashing Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúbig beautiful‚Äù tax bill, especially the part where it axes the $7,500 EV credit, which could hit Tesla‚Äôs bottom line by $1.2B (per JPM estimates). Musk also wasn‚Äôt happy that Trump pulled NASA chief nominee Jared Isaacman, a Musk ally.  Then came the *X wars*. Musk basically implied:  Trump owes him the 2024 win.   Trump‚Äôs EV policy flip was betrayal.     Trump might be in the Epstein files. (Yes, he went there.)  Trump hit back hard ‚Äî said he ""helped Elon a lot"", implied Musk was forced out of the White House role, and even threatened to pull federal contracts (SpaceX/Tesla have gotten $22.5B from gov since 2000).  Musk eventually blinked. After watching Tesla tank and people like Bill Ackman urge de-escalation, Elon replied, *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not wrong.‚Äù*   Translation: wave the white flag, at least *for now*.

stocks,My Analysis of Lululemon LULU ($330.78),"LULU is having a hard time for obvious reasons that a lot of people saw coming for a long time. I personally feel that there is a cultural shift away from LULU and over the long run this would likely trend downwards. This is purely from real people using their products and sharing their opinion. Unlike tech companies these type of companies definitely need the cool factor. LULU's fundamental problem isn't just numbers, it's that they've lost their cultural relevance.  They are down from $330.78 to $265 in pre-market (-20%) after they slashed their full-year EPS guidance.  **The Situation right now:**  * Brand is getting roasted (Vuori and Costco eating their lunch) * Retail sentiment is in the gutter * Smart money was hanging around $330 before the EPS guidance  **Entry Strategy:** Watch the $260-$270 zone like a hawk for ANY sign of support or absorption. But its better to not touch this thing unless:  1. Price reclaims $275+ with actual volume behind it, OR 2. We get a capitulation wick followed by heavy volume reversal  **Targets if this bounces:**  * $285 first (old breakdown area turned resistance)  **Risk Levels:**  * Below $259 = fresh breakdown territory * $248 = psychological level where things get really ugly  **Game Plan:** Watching the open and first 15-30 minutes. No bounce = no entry. Simple as that.  Don't catch a falling knife without confirmation.  *Not financial advice, just sharing my analysis*",2025-06-06T13:23:59,41
stocks,WWDC 2025 is next week  Can Apple finally deliver something real in AI?,"Apple‚Äôs big developer conference kicks off June 9, and Wall Street is *watching closely* ‚Äî especially with the AI hype still going strong.  Last year, Apple teased us with ‚ÄúApple Intelligence,‚Äù their own take on generative AI. Big demos, big promises... but not much follow-through. Siri still isn‚Äôt GPT-level, and most of the AI features we *did* get have been kind of meh.  So what should we expect this year?  Here‚Äôs a quick rundown:   iOS/macOS/iPadOS are getting a major design overhaul, reportedly inspired by the Vision Pro‚Äôs visionOS. Mark Gurman says it‚Äôs the biggest visual revamp since iOS 7.   AI features in smaller doses  like an intelligent battery manager that learns your habits, and live translation for AirPods (finally catching up to Google). But don‚Äôt expect ChatGPT-style magic just yet.   Apple might open its own LLMs to devs, allowing on-device AI apps. That could be a big deal long-term if devs jump in.   New unified gaming app  looks like Apple wants to get serious about gaming. Still miles away from console-level stuff, but their App Store is already a mobile gaming monster.  Also, the iPhone 17 is rumored to be thinner and lighter**,** and paired with the new OS could help reignite sales in China  where Apple‚Äôs been struggling for a few quarters now.  Bottom line: Apple might not blow minds like last year, but if the software updates are slick enough and the AI stuff feels *usable*, it could be enough to get AAPL back in the good graces of investors.",2025-06-06T13:16:03,32
stocks,"(06/6) Trump, TSLA, IPOs, and Rockets! Interesting Stocks Today.","Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.  News: [Musk Blinks First in Bitter Trump Feud That Cost Him $34 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-06/musk-blinks-first-in-bitter-trump-feud-that-cost-him-34-billion)  [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Elon Musk/Trump were in a public feud/argument on Twitter yesterday, and the threat of TSLA's government contracts being cancelled was brought up by Trump. Looking for the second day trade in this- we saw TSLA go to a low of $275 yesterday, so I'm interested to see if we continue selling off or make at least some attempt at recovery. Trump/Musk are expected to speak today to ""cool things down"". This spat is mainly political, another issue to add along with the rest. Musk did threaten to stop work on the Dragon Capsule, Trump threatened to stop all of TSLA/SpaceX's government contracts, causing the stock to fall 50 points throughout the day.  [**VERA (Vera)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VERA&p=d)\- VERA fell 30% after competitor Otsuka reported superior Phase 3 trial results for its IgA nephropathy drug, sibeprenlimab, which achieved a 51.2% reduction in proteinuria compared to Vera's atacicept's 46% reduction. We had seen VERA actually spike up due to their drug report a few days back from $20 ->$37 on this news- it's possible that it'll just stay flat at pre-drug release price.  [**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\- Watching the $100 level for potential breakout or breakdown. I regret not writing a DD for this but I was taking a break. We opened at \~2.5x multiple to the original IPO price and surged past $100 briefly in the first few minutes of trading, we've stayed pretty strong/sustained up since then. I'm interested to see if we can stay fairly at this level. I'm mainly interested in this because CRCL is one of the first listed stable C's on a US listing, and we've seen HUGE interest in recent catalysts that are related to this space/industry.  [**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\- ASTS surged over 13% amid speculation of a potential partnership or investment from Amazon, following social media posts featuring AST's CEO and Jeff Bezos. AMZN is beginning commercialization of its Project Kuiper initiative, a satellite-based project that will deliver retail wireless broadband to Earth (competitor to Starlink). There was a research report released that speculates ASTS's RF wireless service could complement Kuiper's broadband technology, and therefore make sense for an acquisition by AMZN. Regardless of how plausible you think an acquisition this is, this was driven all by a single picture and speculation. So be careful of volatility if nothing happens.",2025-06-06T13:13:43,59

PLTR stepped back to around $120 today, if it stabilizes there and then a positive line with volume, you can 'bet' once, targeting $135-$140; if it fails, consider it as a stop-loss and don't take any chances.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.  But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.  Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.

stocks,$GOOG is successfully transitioning from a search company to an AI company,"For years, we've known Google as the king of search. But if you think that's their only game, you're missing the massive shift that's happening right now. The idea that Google's money will soon come from a lot more than just search isn't some far-off prediction‚Äîit's already happening.  Sure, search still pays the bills. But Google is aggressively building its future around some seriously impressive AI, and it's all starting to pay off. What really sets them apart, though, is their secret weapon: the power to weave their best AI, Gemini, directly into the Google search bar everyone already uses.  # Google's ""Unfair"" Advantage: Upgrading Search for Billions  This is the kicker. No other AI company, not even OpenAI, has this kind of advantage. Google can take its powerful Gemini AI and plug it straight into its search engine. Imagine, instead of just typing keywords and getting a list of links, you have a conversation with a super-smart AI that gives you direct answers.  Google can slowly shift billions of us from the classic search page to this new AI-powered experience. They don't have to find new users; they're already on Google's homepage. This means Google can test, learn, and improve its AI with more data than anyone else, creating a feedback loop that will be almost impossible for competitors to catch.  # So, is Gemini Actually Better Than ChatGPT?  That's the big question. While people love to debate which AI is ""smarter,"" it's a bit more complicated. Both are incredibly good, but they have different strengths. The key for Google is that Gemini is getting really good at being accurate and not ""hallucinating""‚Äîwhich is the creepy AI habit of just making things up. You can't have an AI powering the world's search engine if it's spitting out fiction. So, Google's obsession with factual accuracy is exactly what's needed for the next generation of search.  # It's Not Just Search, Though. Google's AI is Everywhere.  Google's game plan is much bigger than just upgrading its main product. They're building entire businesses around AI:  * **A Personal Expert for Your Documents (NotebookLM):** This might be one of the coolest, most useful AI tools out there. You feed NotebookLM your own documents‚Äîreports, articles, class notes, whatever‚Äîand it becomes an expert on *only that information*. It will summarize, answer questions, and even give you citations, all without pulling in random stuff from the internet. It‚Äôs a game-changer for anyone who has to wade through a lot of text. * **Self-Driving Cars Are Here (Waymo):** While a lot of companies are still just talking about self-driving cars, Google's sister company Waymo is actually doing it. With millions of miles driven on real roads, their cars are already on the streets of several cities, operating as a ride-hailing service. They are, without a doubt, the leader in the self-driving race, which could be a monstrously huge business. * **The Powerhouse in the Background (Google Cloud):** All of this AI magic needs a ton of computing power, and that's where Google Cloud comes in. Its revenue is skyrocketing (up 28% in one recent quarter) because thousands of other companies are paying Google to use its powerful infrastructure to build their own AI tools. It's a classic ""selling shovels in a gold rush"" strategy, and it's working beautifully.  This kind of massive pivot isn't new, and the smartest companies have done it before. Look at Apple. It went from being a computer company on the ropes to the most powerful force in mobile by seeing that the future was in devices like the iPod and iPhone. Or consider Netflix. It started as a DVD-by-mail service and made the terrifying decision to blow up its own profitable business to lead the charge into streaming. They knew that if you don't disrupt yourself, someone else will. What Google is doing right now is playing from the same book. It's using its current strength to build what comes next, ensuring that as the world changes, it will be the one driving that change, not just reacting to it.",2025-06-06T08:48:06,0

It expects its full-year earnings per share to be between $14.58 to $14.78. Previously, it expected full-year earnings per share to be in the range of $14.95 to $15.15 for the year. Analysts anticipated earnings per share of $14.89, according to LSEG.  Lululemon‚Äôs report comes after a string of retailers reduced or withdrew their guidance and said they would¬†hike prices¬†because of uncertainty surrounding President¬†Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff regime. Retailers including¬†Abercrombie & Fitch¬†and¬†Macy‚Äôs¬†slashed their profit outlooks, while others, including¬†American Eagle Outfitters¬†pulled their full-year guidance altogether.  Among Lululemon‚Äôs rivals in the athleticwear category specifically, Gap, which owns athleisure brand Athleta,¬†reported¬†last week that it expects tariffs to impact its business by $100 million to $150 million. Nike told CNBC last month it would begin¬†raising prices¬†on a wide range of products, though it did not specify whether tariffs were the reason for the hikes.¬†  Lululemon reported net income for the fiscal first quarter of $314 million, or $2.60 per share, compared with a net income of $321 million, or $2.54 per share, a year earlier.  First-quarter revenue rose to $2.37 billion, up from about $2.21 billion during the same period in 2024.  Lululemon expects second-quarter revenue to total between $2.54 billion and $2.56 billion. It also anticipates full-year fiscal 2025 revenue to be $11.15 billion to $11.3 billion ‚Äî unchanged from its last forecast. Wall Street analysts were expecting revenue of $2.56 billion for the second quarter and $11.24 billion for the full year, according to LSEG.  The activewear company expects to post earnings per share in the range of $2.85 to $2.90 for the second quarter, compared to Wall Street‚Äôs expectation of $3.29, according to LSEG.  Before Trump‚Äôs sweeping April 2 tariff announcement, the company said during its previous earnings call in March that it expected a minimal hit to profits from tariffs.  During 2024, 40% of Lululemon‚Äôs products were manufactured in Vietnam, 17% in Cambodia, 11% in Sri Lanka, 11% in Indonesia, 7% in Bangladesh and the remainder in other regions, according to the company‚Äôs¬†annual report. Lululemon does not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and relies on suppliers to produce and provide fabrics for its products, according to the report.¬†  Comparable sales rose 1% year over year for the quarter, compared to the 3% Wall Street was anticipating, according to StreetAccount. That number includes a 2% decrease in the Americas and a 6% increase internationally.  Gross margin was 58.3%, ahead of the 57.7% that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.  As of Thursday‚Äôs close, LULU stock has dropped about 13% year-to-date.

stocks,Tesla shares sink 8% as Musk-Trump spat over budget bill boils over,"Shares of¬†Tesla¬†slid 8% on Thursday as CEO¬†Elon Musk¬†and President¬†Donald Trump¬†traded barbs over the spending bill making its way through Congress.  Trump spoke from the Oval Office Thursday and said Musk was upset that EV credits were not included in the bill.  ‚ÄúElon and I had a great relationship. I don‚Äôt know if we will anymore,‚Äù Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday. ‚ÄúI was surprised.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhatever,‚Äù Musk fired back as the president spoke.  ‚ÄúWithout me, Trump would have lost the¬†election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,‚Äù he posted on X.  Musk, the world‚Äôs richest man, in recent days has threatened to make lawmakers who vote for the bill face primary elections and called the bill a ‚Äúdisgusting abomination,‚Äù marking a significant shift in his comments about the administration.  The fall in shares comes after the EV maker saw a 22% rally in May despite weak sales numbers, with Musk wrapping up his time as head of Trump‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or¬†DOGE.  Shares are down more than 20% this year and well off the high of $488.54 reached Dec. 18.  Since Musk‚Äôs special government employee term ended Friday, he‚Äôs appeared at odds with the¬†Trump administration¬†and gone on a full assault against the president‚Äôs signature¬†tax-cut bill.  ‚ÄúOne of the things about Elon is when he goes all in, he goes all in,‚Äù Walter Isaacson, author of a Musk biography, told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù on Thursday.  ‚ÄúHe is somebody who‚Äôs not exactly calibrated in these things and he is seriously upset,‚Äù Isaacson said.  NBC News reported that Musk had tried to convince Trump and other GOP members of the administration to change aspects of Trump‚Äôs bill that would curtail EV and residential solar¬†tax credits, which generate profits for Tesla.  The measure would also impose a new annual $250 fee on EV drivers.¬†  Tesla is facing more fundamental problems, with¬†plummeting sales¬†of its electric vehicles in major markets in Europe and a declining brand reputation in the West.  Tesla is also under pressure to launch a long-delayed, driverless ride-hailing service this month¬†in Austin, Texas.  Musk has said that Tesla is testing driverless vehicles in that market, but its primary competitor Waymo is already operating a major commercial robotaxi service there in partnership with Uber.  Isaacson said Thursday that Musk was also annoyed with members of the Trump administration who worked against the nomination of¬†Jared Isaacman¬†as head of space agency NASA.  ‚ÄúThat, to Musk, was just infuriating because they were doing, they were going after Jared Isaacman ... to get at Musk,‚Äù Isaacson said Thursday.  Isaacman‚Äôs nomination was pulled over the weekend.  Isaacman led two private spaceflights through Musk‚Äôs SpaceX, in 2021 and 2024, commanding crews on trips around the Earth. His payment tech company Shift4 said in financial filings that as of June 30, 2021, it had invested $27.5 million in SpaceX as well.

President Donald Trump signed an order in March that directed federal agencies to remove ‚Äúunnecessary barriers‚Äù to data consolidation. Even before that, as The New York Times reported last week, Palantir had expanded the reach of its artificial intelligence product within the US government ‚Äî potentially building an interagency database that would merge huge sets of government information on Americans, from medical to financial. Palantir provides tech to companies and governments that helps them act on the information they collect ‚Äî a service gaining traction as large language models make it easier to analyze data at scale. The US government has long lagged the private sector in that sort of analysis ‚Äî but where Silicon Valley sees a chance to make government more efficient, some lawmakers in both parties see an invitation to misuse.  > ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dangerous,‚Äù Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, told Semafor. ‚ÄúWhen you start combining all those data points on an individual into one database, it really essentially creates a digital ID. And it‚Äôs a power that history says will eventually be abused.‚Äù ‚ÄúI hope to turn it off, fundamentally,‚Äù Davidson added. He compared a Palantir-facilitated merged database to the dangerously powerful ring from the Lord of The Rings: ‚ÄúThe only good thing to do with One Ring to Rule Them All is to destroy the Ring.‚Äô‚Äù  > Resistance like Davidson‚Äôs is striking because few congressional Republicans have publicly challenged the president since his second term began. Neither the sweeping cutbacks of DOGE nor Trump‚Äôs punitive global tariffs have caused a real GOP rebellion, and the party is currently reinterpreting years of fury about deficits to push through a megabill that adds trillions of dollars in debt. It‚Äôs far from clear that the work by Palantir ‚Äî whose co-founder Peter Thiel is a longtime backer of Vice President JD Vance ‚Äî will end up sparking a significant GOP attempt to rein in the Trump administration. Davidson said he hopes to mount a bipartisan push to include language that would shut down the effort in legislation reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is set to lapse next year.",2025-06-05T17:01:24,887

stocks,Stablecoin company Circle goes Public,"The IPO for the stablecoin giant Circle Internet Group is hot right now. Circle rang the bell at NYSE opening this morning.  This enthusiasm shows investors are bullish again, eager for another ride on the crypto train.  Circle has priced its IPO at $31 a share, comfortably above the initial range of $24-$26, which shows they believe there's strong demand.   This puts Circle at a market cap of about $6.8 billion, potentially reaching nearly $8 billion if underwriters exercise their options. All told, the company will raise roughly $1.1 billion, which according to their S-1 they plan to use to 'invest in new products and capabilities + raise awareness'   Circle is best known for USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. Unlike the implicitly volatile rides of Bitcoin or Ethereum, USDC stays steady around $1, making it ideal for payments and as a stable digital store of value... but, and they say this constantly in their S-1, they have to navigate an extremely complex and regulated system (the global financial system).  Their mission is to 'raise global economic prosperity through the frictionless exchange of value'.   Right now, USDC trails Tether‚Äôs USDT, with market caps of $61.5 billion versus USDT's $153.8 billion. **But Circle is profitable**, thanks to interest earned on reserves, and there's a big opportunity ahead if it expands into payment services.  Regulation is shifting too. The GENIUS Act, currently in Congress, could be a game-changer for Circle, providing the clarity needed for stablecoins to really thrive in the U.S. Analyst Jacob Zuller sees Circle potentially growing its market share from 28% to 40%, capitalizing on this emerging regulatory landscape.  The new Administration is also more bullish on easing up Crypto regulation.   What do y'all think of Circle? For me, I'm just glad to see the IPO market churning again.  Disclosure: I'm a Buffett-style investor, and after reading the S-1, I can comfortably say this is in my ""too hard"" pile.

stocks,Is NVIDIA Getting Too Hot? My Short-Term Concerns with NVDA ($141.92),"I wrote my thesis on Palantir 30 mins before posting this one and looks like folks are not liking it. Long term NVDA could go up. This is purely a short term play.   This is going to be a similar take to that one.   NVIDIA‚Äôs been on an insane run lately. It was up over 20% since mid May and pushing back to all time highs around $142. The AI hype is obviously still alive and well. I genuinely believe AI is the future but still we need to be a bit more realistic.  Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs making me cautious:  * Options activity is nuts right now ‚Äî the $140‚Äì$150 calls are getting snapped up like crazy * Lots of short-dated call buying, mostly retail * The whole ‚Äúit can‚Äôt go down‚Äù vibe is creeping back in * The stock‚Äôs up 10‚Äì12% straight with barely any pause  To be clear, I‚Äôm not saying NVDA is a bad company. It‚Äôs a beast, and the AI story is real. But even the strongest stocks usually pull back a bit after a move like this.  I‚Äôm looking at a possible short if it pushes into the $143‚Äì$145 range. Nothing aggressive, just a trade idea. Thinking we could see a pullback to $135ish (which lines up with the last breakout zone).  If it breaks above $147 though, I‚Äôm out. Could easily rip to $150+ from there.  Not trying to fade the long-term trend here. I am just synthesizing unusual market activity, insider moves, options flow, sentiment, technical and news analysis.  Disclaimer: Not Financial Advice.",2025-06-05T13:30:57,21
stocks,"CBO: Trump's $2.4T Tax Cut Bill Might Be ""Paid For"" by‚Ä¶Tariffs?! (Yes, Really)","So here's the latest twist from DC: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) just released two reports on Trump‚Äôs new ‚ÄúBig Beautiful Bill‚Äù   and it's got both sides of the aisle scrambling.     Report 1 says: If passed, Trump‚Äôs tax bill would increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years. Some independent estimates say $5 trillion+ if temporary cuts become permanent (and let‚Äôs be honest, when don‚Äôt they?).    Report 2 (and here‚Äôs the kicker): Tariffs implemented under Trump could offset $2.8 trillion in deficits   if they stay in place forever, which is about as likely as Elon Musk deleting his X account.    The CBO notes tariffs might bring in $$, but also shrink the economy, raise inflation, and maybe even violate international trade law. Minor details, right?    Meanwhile, the Trump team is doing gymnastics:    Calling the CBO ‚Äúpartisan‚Äù     Then turning around and saying we should totally believe the tariff report because it helps their narrative   Oh, and Elon Musk called the bill a ""disgusting abomination."" When Elon sounds like a budget hawk, you know things are getting weird.    Let‚Äôs not forget:  Tariffs = presidential policy = reversible with a pen  Tax cuts = law = hard to undo    Marc Goldwein put it bluntly: ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt count on $3 trillion of possibly illegal tariffs... to pay for tax cuts that can‚Äôt be undone without another law.‚Äù",2025-06-05T13:27:02,746

""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL,"" Musk¬†posted on X¬†on Wednesday.  Musk¬†added, ""If the massive deficit spending continues, there will only be money for interest payments and nothing else!""  The vocal criticism is irking Trump, the¬†Wall Street Journal¬†reported, with a senior official claiming that White House advisors were ""caught off guard"" by Musk's latest broadsides.  Tesla stock fell solidly on Wednesday and extended those losses in premarket trading on Thursday, down as much as 3%.  The comments come after the one-time leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) waded earnestly into the debate over the bill this week,¬†angrily¬†posting Tuesday that it was a ""disgusting abomination.""  ""I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,"" he said.  ""Shame on those"" who voted for it in the House, Musk added.  Bloomberg reported that Musk may also be driven by the fact that the¬†federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.  Musk's barrage comes as the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, and a¬†Congressional Budget Office estimation¬†of its impact on the deficit adds fuel to Musk's line of argument.  The nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.  The formerly Musk-led DOGE itself has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find, and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.  Musk's closeness to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for Tesla, given its business with SpaceX and NASA and the regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.

Tesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.  Meanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG,¬†GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating¬†250,000 robotaxi trips per week.",2025-06-05T13:01:00,1292

stocks,My Bearish Take on Palantir PLTR ($130.01). Short Term Analysis.,"**For Context:**  PLTR has been on an absolute tear this year. It was up over 60% YTD on AI hype and retail momentum. Currently sitting around $130.01, but I'm starting to think this might be getting ahead of itself. Only for the short term though.  **Here's what's got me bearish in the short term:**   We're seeing some classic overextension signs. Price is trading $8+ above the 20-day moving average, RSI is in the mid-60s, and the options flow is getting pretty frothy with heavy call buying at $130-135 strikes. IV is over 60% which usually screams speculative euphoria rather than institutional accumulation.  What really stands out to me is how PLTR keeps failing to hold above $133-134. It's tried multiple times but can't seem to stick. Meanwhile, there's no major fundamental catalyst justifying these levels. It feels like pure momentum and AI narrative driving it.  I'm eyeing a draw down back to the $120-122 zone where it was consolidating in late May. That would be a pretty normal pullback after a run like this.  **The setup:** Looking to short on any failed retests above $132-134, or if it shows weakness below $129 with declining volume. First target around $124, then maybe $120 if momentum really breaks. Stop would be above $135. If it breaks that with volume, this thesis is wrong and we could see a gamma squeeze.  Obviously this is just short-term technical thinking. Long-term, PLTR might be fine, but right now it feels stretched.  Anyone else seeing this as overextended? Or do you think I'm fighting the trend here? Always curious to hear other perspectives, especially since momentum can stay irrational longer than expected.  What's everyone's take on PLTR at these levels?   I would really appreciate it if you guys took time to check back in after a week or two and let me know if the analysis worked out.

stocks,The iShares Defense Industrials Active ETF (IDEF) is the most diversified defense sector ETF available to date.,"One of the themes of 2025 has been Defense ETFs with the geopolitical tensions in the world today which saw the rise of Europe Defense ETFs earlier this year that diversified away from US defense ETFs. With BlackRock/iShares latest offering (IDEF), I document my reasons why I think IDEF should be a *must-have* for investors who want an ***actively managed and diversified investment in the Global defense sector.***  # Context:  * Prior to the launch of IDEF, there were only a several defense ETFs available for US investors which were also aerospace heavy (e.g. Boeing). * The prominent ETFs which have had good performance are SHLD (Global X Defense Tech ETF) and for non-US investors, there was also DFNS (VanEck Defense UCITS ETF USD A). * Recently, there have been EU-centric ETFs that came to prominence with the increased EU spending, such as EUAD (Select STOXX Europe Aerospace & Defense ETF), NATO (HANEtf The Global Defence ETF) and several others.  # The cons of the above:  1. Many of these ETFs have large concentration in aerospace companies rather than defense companies (e.g. Boeing), 2. Many of these also bloat with cybersecurity companies rather than defense companies (e.g. Crowdstrike, Palo Alto, Cisco), 3. High concentration and limited holdings. Particularly with the EU defense, you see high concentration in one to three companies (e.g. Rheinmetall, Thales, BAE, etc) which each hold an average of 10-15% weight in the portfolio, while ETFs such as DFNS are concentrated in 20-30 holdings, 4. With the prominence of Palantir, it also holds a high concentration in these ETFs of around 7-10%.  # What makes IDEF better and more well diversified:  1. It has approximately 120+ holdings, higher than any other Defense ETF, 2. The fund is actively managed, unlike majority of others which just track an index of companies thrown together to fit a theme, 3. Portfolio has exposure to South Korea, France, UK, Japan, Germany, Israel, Italy, Sweden, Canada, Australia, Singapore. The highest weight is just under 6% of all holdings (GE AEROSPACE, 5.58% as of 3 June) 4. The portfolio has the usual defense favorites such as Palantir, Thales, Rheinmetall, Rolls-Royce, Airbus and many more, 5. The portfolio also includes gems and companies that serve national defense infrastructure like Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd (Singapore - 70% YTD), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (Japan - 48% YTD), DroneShield Ltd (Australia - 117% YTD), 6. The portfolio also includes small exposures to potential high growth companies like Rocket Lab Inc, Archer Aviation, C3.ai, Redwire, Bigbear.ai, 7. Expense ratio is 0.55% which is in-line with other Defense ETFs but considered low when you consider this is actively managed compared to those that passively track an index or basket of companies.  # Downsides to the ETF:  * While this is currently the ETF which is the most diversified and has a large number of holdings, it is still US heavy at 59%. * Being iShares/BlackRock, feels like there will always be the usual suspects such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin included. * Current volume is low as the fund was only incepted on 19 May 2025, less than a month ago.  # How to address the downsides:  * To balance out the US heavy concentration, consider supplementing together with an EU defense ETF if you want more exposure to EU and less to US. There is no Asia/Oceanic ETF at the moment. * To balance out the Boeing/Lockheed holdings, consider supplementing together with SHLD which does not hold these, and is arguably the 2nd best defense ETF available on the market.

stocks,How the Travel Ban wil impact the market,"It honestly amazes me how few people are paying attention to what just happened with Trump‚Äôs latest travel ban. Everyone‚Äôs so caught up in Fed policy and inflation chatter that they're missing what could very well be the final domino before a full-blown economic collapse.  I‚Äôm not being dramatic. Every major downturn has a trigger. In 2008, it was housing. In 1929, it was stock speculation and credit overreach. In 2025, it might just be a strategically clueless travel ban that alienates key international partners and sends a chilling signal to global markets. And yes, I‚Äôm talking specifically about Chad and Equatorial Guinea.  Before anyone dismisses this as alarmism, let‚Äôs look at facts. These countries might not be G7 members, but they play legitimate roles in global energy and regional investment. Equatorial Guinea is a notable oil exporter with deepening ties to Asian and European markets. Chad controls critical logistical routes and sits on a growing pool of untapped resources that Western companies have been quietly trying to access. Cutting them off doesn‚Äôt just hurt diplomacy‚Äîit signals instability.  And then there‚Äôs the optics. This move tells the world the US is still willing to embrace arbitrary, discriminatory foreign policy even when the economic consequences are subtle but dangerous. Investors abroad notice this. Funds notice this. Market confidence doesn‚Äôt survive in a climate where policy feels like a coin flip.  Tourism, international education, trade partnerships‚Äîthese are soft power pipelines that get silently throttled by decisions like this. In a fragile, overleveraged market already addicted to hopium, something this specific and poorly thought out can spark a sentiment collapse. The same way subprime triggered a credit meltdown, this could rattle international investor trust just enough to start the slide.  For what it‚Äôs worth, I sold everything two days after Liberation Day. My brokerage account, my 401k, my kids‚Äô 529. Gone. All of it. I‚Äôve been sitting in 100 percent cash ever since. Laugh if you want, but while everyone else was FOMO-buying tech at 40x earnings, I was reading between the lines.  And right now, those lines are flashing red.  But hey‚Äîmaybe I‚Äôm wrong and the stock market will just keep grinding up forever on vibes, stimulus hangovers, and denial. Maybe a travel ban targeting resource-rich African nations has zero macro implications. Maybe the market is priced to perfection.  Or maybe the next leg down starts exactly where nobody thought to look.  Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you.",2025-06-05T02:46:42,0

stocks,Investing $5000 as a 17 Year Old,"I am a 17 Year Old With $9000 and want to know if this plan is okay. For context, I used to be a server which is how I made my money, but now I do not work and only earn a bit of money though babysitting/selling my old clothes/etc. This money has just been sitting in my checking and savings account for the last 3 years, earning less than a dollar of interest per year ...  I did a lot of research and made a plan for what to do with this money. Keep in mind I am going to college in the fall, but I don't have to do any loans/payment because I got a lot of scholarships and parents got the rest. So I just wanted to ask how my plan is and if anyone has any advice:  Checking account: $750 (I'm pretty frugal/don't spend much money, though I know I will have to spend more in college)  High Yield Savings Account: $3000  Stocks (About $4500) These are the ones I currently have picked out and how much I would put in. Should I get rid of any and just put it all in SPLG or SCHD or is this ok?  SPLG (50%) SCHD (35%) VUG (10%) NVDA (5%)  then i was thinking about putting $500 in a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. But should I just wait until I get a part time job (probably a few months) to make a Roth IRA? Because you need income to contribute to one right?  To summarize I just want to know if those stocks I picked are good or if I should get rid of some or choose others, and if I should make a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund or wait until I have a job to make a Roth IRA.",2025-06-04T20:45:50,0
stocks,Wanna see a weird chart? (KBGGY),"The time to make money on this has probably passed, but over the last two days there was some weird shit happening with this ADR.  If anyone has an idea as to what's going on, I'd like to hear it.  https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KBGGY/  Here is Kongsberg Group.  My understanding is that they're a Norwegian defense company with fingers in many different pies.  I had been sitting in this for maybe a month or two, watching my Norwegian blood money pile up at a nice steady rate.  What they do isn't really relevant.  Look at the 5y / 1y / ytd, etc.  Ignoring the last two days, it's a fairly steady riser.  now, look at the 5 day.  For some reason, it spiked hard yesterday.  It wasn't a gradual hype train, it was   ""Someone decided to buy this equity at a 60+% markup"".  My assumption was that someone fat-fingered an order.  So, I decided to sell a bit.  And for some reason, my order went through at that price.  The rest of the day, we stayed at this inflated price.  Went to bed.  Woke up this morning, and somehow, it happened *again*.  an even higher spike.  We go all the way up to 250.  I look at the ask, and what does it read?  something in the range of 340+, with a current bid at 250ish.  What?  So obviously, I attempt to dump my remaining shares in this.  I can't just give up a 3x return - I get out at 250ish.  Since then, the price is still $30 above the price it had jumped to yesterday.  Can someone try to explain what happened here?  My only guess would be something outlandish - someone fat-fingered an order, someone is trying to manipulate the stock price, some algorithmic trading gone wrong, Norwegian government decides to buy at.... a ridiculous premium, or something like that.

stocks,"Are we facing a stock market crash in July? Trump's ""Section 899""","Section 899, which Trump wants to introduce in July, is part of the ""One Big, Beautiful Bill Act"" package. Its main goal is to increase U.S. tax rates for foreign entities (individuals and corporations). Companies and individuals from countries deemed ""discriminatory"" would be charged higher tax rates in the U.S. It is proposed to increase these rates by 5% annually for four years, which gives a total increase of 20% above the current rate. This applies to, among others, income from U.S. sources (dividends, interest, royalties).  That is, profits from US bonds and dividends would be taxed instead of 15% (the current real rate for most countries) would increase to:  20% from January 1, 2026   25% from January 1, 2027   30% from January 1, 2028   35% from January 1, 2029  Effects of the introduction:  1. Reduced demand for US stocks (falls on stock exchanges due to the withdrawal of foreign investors)  2. Weakening of the dollar due to capital outflow  3. Loss of confidence in the predictability of US policy, increased risk that there will be no one willing to roll over US debt and everything will fall apart like a house of cards  18% of the value of investments in US stocks is foreign capital. A sudden outflow of even half of this capital would be catastrophic and would almost certainly cause huge declines on the US stock exchanges, probably in the tens of percent range, or even lead to a crash because:  \- A huge supply of stocks without sufficient demand   \- A domino effect and market panic (e.g. ETFs would have to sell stocks, which would deepen the declines)   \- A recession (a sharp decline in stock values ‚Äã‚Äãand a loss of investor confidence would lead to a drastic drop in consumption and investment, plunging the US economy into a deep recession)   \- A loss of bank liquidity (banks and financial institutions that hold significant stock portfolios or are connected to the capital market would face serious liquidity problems. Credit would become more expensive and difficult to obtain, hampering economic development)  Do you think we will see a stock market crisis in July or by the end of the year when people realize what regulations are coming into effect?",2025-06-04T16:58:02,738

investing,Trump to keep 55% tariffs on Chinese imports which is not good,"Well this is kinda messed up.. First Trump yesterday announced that the deal with China ""was done"" but now it turns out that China is still stuck with 55% tariffs or more precise a ""base rate"" of 30% on all Chinese goods plus an additional 25% on specific goods. This basically means that the China tariffs that so far had been delayed will now actually become a permanent of at least 30% on everything which really is a high number that could push up retail prices hence push up inflation. I honestly wonder if China is okay with this as their core demand was to get rid of the tariffs in return for resuming exporting rare minerals to US companies. The main consequence of this is we could see alot more price hikes in coming months. Not sure why this is presented as a ""good deal"" as this is neither good for US consumer nor China. Did China actually agree with this? I honestly doubt Xi Jinping will approve of this since with China controlling 90% of rare minerals which US companies desperately gives China alot of leverage.

What Is the Fund?**  * A pooled investment where multiple investors (like us) put money together.   * The fund uses this capital to invest in private startups by buying shares in those startups.   * Investors own shares of the fund, not the startups directly.    # 2. Holding Shares & Valuation  * Fund owns shares in startups.    * Fund uses latest funding round valuations as reference points.   * Fund can provide regular updates to investors on portfolio value and startup progress.    # 3. Selling Shares  * Investors can sell their shares of the fund, not startup shares directly.   * Fund may facilitate this through a **secondary market** where investors trade fund shares.   * Liquidity events (e.g., IPOs, acquisitions, exits) enable the fund to convert startup shares to cash, which can be distributed to investors or reinvested.    **Questions:**  * Has anyone already built this?

This number is expected to increase to 140k in about a year. I‚Äôm looking at duplexes because the single family homes in my area are overpriced and I‚Äôll quickly grow out of them). I‚Äôm looking at two duplexes priced at 500k to 625k.  Cash: 100k  Bonds: 10k  Retirement: 5k (26 and just got out of law school)  Stocks: 6k  Debt: school loans 15k  Rent for the second unit I‚Äôd estimate around 2k for either duplex.  Both duplexes are 1920s builds. They‚Äôre in the same town that has a great school system and limited rental availability.  The one listed for 500k is smaller has more cosmetic updates and dedicated utilities. I like the shape of the lot because it‚Äôs on a side street and basically the length of said street.   The 625k house is a bigger classier looking house and definitely more my style. It‚Äôs outdated to some but to me it has charm. Utilities are not split. I can charge more for rent but have to factor in potential abuse. Solar loan at $182. I am confident I can get this property for 625k but hoping to get it around 600k.  I know investors typically buy 3 families for better returns. Surprisingly a lot of duplexes are sitting in this hot market.   Is it a good idea to invest in a duplex and which one should I invest in?,2025-06-11T03:24:04,1
investing,Roth IRA - Is a Boglehead 3-Fund Investment Strategy Enough These Days?,"I'm 40 and I just recently added FXNAX to my existing Roth IRA portfolio of FSKAX and FTIHX. And allocation as follows:  **FSKAX (60%)**   **FTIHX (30%)**   **FXNAX (10%)**  According to Boglehead's philosophy on a 3-fund portfolio, it's suppose to be a simple, low-cost long-term investment strategy that offers broad diversification. But, I'm just uncertain if the rate of inflation (And especially cost of living) can prove to be challenging. My goal, like most people, is to generate as much retirement income to hedge inflation and have more purchasing power 30 years from now.

Yes or no?,"Hello everyone, I'm looking for some advice and hope you can help! :)  I'm 23 and I currently have around 10K in various stocks, mostly concentrated in the S&P 500 (about 2.3K), Apple (2K) and Berkshire Hathaway (1.8K).   Every week, I put $15 into the S&P 500 and another $10 in Berkshire Hathaway. They are my only regularly scheduled investments but occasionally I will buy other things (I bought $500 in Costco this year for example). I started investing maybe 4 years ago and I'm up a little over 50% all time.  My question is this: I'd like to have money put away in an IRA as it seems sensible to do. I've started offloading my smaller single stocks, and putting that money back in the S&P.   Is there a way to transfer my stock into an IRA without selling?

investing,Understanding junk bond prices,"I'm trying to understand quotes for bond prices and I feel like I'm missing some things. (To be clear, I am not asking about the wisdom of investing in junk bonds, nor am I actively looking to do so; I'm just trying to make sure I understand the concepts, and edge cases are sometimes a good way to test understanding.)  Let's take the FRCB Corp Aug01'46 bond as an example. Extremely low liquidity, so the prices may be misleading, but I just want to make sure I'm understanding the concepts correctly.      The current ask price is 0.68, which means it is trading for less than 1% of its par value (is that correct?). Face value is $1000. The coupon rate is 4.4 and semi-annual, which means it would pay $44 every 6 months for every $1000 of face value (is that correct?).   Now, if I'm understanding right (which I assume I am not), that would mean that for $68, you get paid $44 every 6 months and $1000 in 22 years.       If that is somehow right, what aspects of the bond make it worth so little? Is it something about it being called back? Is the bond part of First Republic's bankruptcy and expected to never get paid? And whatever the answer is, where can I go to find this sort of info about a given bond in order to do due diligence?",2025-06-10T17:10:26,0

investing,Why I Buy (Not Build) SaaS,"After buying and selling SaaS businesses for the past couple of years, I‚Äôve learned the hard way that the best deals aren‚Äôt on the big-name marketplaces. Here‚Äôs my straight-shooting take.  **Marketplaces Like Acquire & Flippa: The Downsides**  * Every ‚Äúgood‚Äù listing attracts a swarm of buyers, expecting 20+ competing offers. * Brokers and platforms tack on 15‚Äì20% to the price, sometimes more. * Most public listings are there for a reason: the business has issues, or the seller is desperate. * You‚Äôre rarely getting a thriving, low-maintenance SaaS that rarely hits the open market.  **Why Buying Is Better Than Building (for Most)**  * Buying gets you an established product, proven revenue, and real customers, no need to spend years building, marketing, and hoping for traction * Yes, you‚Äôll pay more upfront, but you skip the grind of development, finding product-market fit, and building from zero * I‚Äôve acquired two SaaS products directly from niche communities (think private FB groups and Twitter threads), better prices, less competition, and more transparent seller conversations.  **What‚Äôs Working for Me**  * Building relationships in small online communities is where the real value is, buyers and sellers are more open, and deals are often off-market. * Skip the hype. If you want to buy SaaS, spend your time where founders actually hang out, not just where brokers list the leftovers.  **TL;DR:**¬†The best SaaS deals aren‚Äôt on the front page of Flippa or Acquire. They‚Äôre in the DMs, group chats, and smaller circles. Build your network, and you‚Äôll find better, more honest opportunities.

investing,Is tokenization the next phase in traditional asset investing?,"I‚Äôve been seeing more discussion lately around real world assets (RWAs) being brought on-chain everything from tokenized treasury bills to real estate, even stocks.  the idea is simple: instead of needing a brokerage account or fiat rails, you can gain exposure to traditional assets directly through blockchain tokens. It‚Äôs not the first time we‚Äôve seen this concept (REITs and ETFs have done it in TradFi for years), but this time, it‚Äôs programmable and global.  what caught my attention recently was how some protocols are now offering 24/7 on chain trading of tokenized stocks and bonds backed by regulated custodians and structured to be bankruptcy-remote. One I found had already crossed $500M in tokenized asset volume.  I‚Äôm wondering:  * Is this just another crypto experiment, or a legit pathway for global capital access? * How would regulation evolve if more investors (especially from non U.S. markets) start allocating capital into U.S. equities via tokens? * What do you think are the long-term implications for brokers and traditional custodians?  would love to hear how others view this trend.

Those signs on ""liberation day,"" didn't feel liberating.

I know that there are backtesting strategies for trading, that simulate a random market and how well your strategy does compared to it. But how does this work for investing? Can you only backtest a single stock or is it possible to backtest a stock package? Is it only possible to backtest using REAL historical data?    You're answers will be much appreciated and correct me for mistakes, since I'm not a professional.",2025-06-09T12:25:50,2
investing,CFD Overnight Interest - What is the total overnight interest percent per year? (see example),"It's been a while since I bought CFD's and initially was introduced to them and investing by my brother. I soon realised that I wasn't keen on using much leverage and a stocks account was where I should be investing my savings. Despite that, I did make a reasonable return on CFD's through long positions even after the overnight interest fees had been paid.   I'm now considering opening a CFD account in trading 212 to invest at most 5-10% of what is in my Stocks and shares account and invest account. I had a look at Nvidia for example and the leverage they offer is 5:1. The overnight interest rate is 0.0694% on this. Assuming I am only considering long hold positions (or more likely swing trading), does this mean that in overnight fees alone, I would be paying 28.8% on the value of the stock in fees after 1 year? (calculated by 1.000694 ^ 365 = ~1.288). I assume also that this overnight percentage can change whenever they feel like it too and that the fee is based on the current value so if the investment goes up in value, so does the fee and so the 28.8% could end up being more than this?    Genuinely makes me wonder how I made money with CFD's in the first place as I didn't leverage that much. Maybe 2x at most.    In the example above, to make any money in Nvidia, I would have to beat that 28.8% return in 1 year? So if I leveraged 2x, and the share price rose by 15% in the same year, I'd have only made 1.2%?",2025-06-09T11:26:44,1

investing,"Roth Picks? Starting a Roth IRA at 51 yrs (already 401 and other passive inc investments), target in 5-10 years.","Which stocks would be considered good choices for a Roth IRA over 10 years?  So am almost 51.

investing,What would you pay for Berkshire Hathaway? Here‚Äôs how I think about it.,"Someone asked me recently, *‚ÄúWhat would you pay for Berkshire Hathaway?‚Äù* Thought I‚Äôd open it up here because I think it‚Äôs a pretty relevant question right now.  Berkshire‚Äôs not a typical company. It‚Äôs part operating business, part investment portfolio. You‚Äôre getting businesses like Geico and BNSF, but also huge public holdings in Apple, Coca-Cola, AmEx, and more. Plus a massive cash position, well over $100 billion.  So how do you value that?  First, I look at **book value**. Historically, Berkshire trades around 1.3 to 1.5 times book. But with interest rates rising and market multiples normalizing, that should compress.  Warren Buffett himself has said he would buy back shares at **1.2 times book value or below** if he believes the stock is trading below intrinsic value. That is a pretty strong signal, and it gives us a decent benchmark.  Second, I look at **earnings power**. Between its operating businesses and its investment portfolio, Berkshire is still a cash machine. But it is no longer a 20 percent compounding machine like it was in its early days. The law of large numbers applies here.  If I had to name a number today, I would start getting interested around that 1.2x book value range. Maybe lower depending on how the macro looks. Anything much higher and I do not see the margin of safety.  Would love to hear how others are approaching Berkshire. Are you a buyer here, or are you waiting for a pullback? How do you factor in the Apple position or Buffett‚Äôs eventual departure?",2025-06-09T04:43:52,0

investing,Consolidating accounts and might restructure.  Seeking advice.,"Hello everyone - I'm consolidating several older accounts from previous employers and will roll it all over into a single account with Fidelity for ease of management.  I recently heard about GOF and the high yields it provides, and thought about if that is a good resource for me to draw upon.  Before we go too far:  I am 40, and plan to retire some where around 65ish.  I already have a small amount saved up on Fidelity spread pretty evenly across QQQM, VOO, and FSELX.       Here is my dilemma between two strategies:     1.  When I roll over my other accounts it will be about $27K total.  I thought about the idea of buying $27K worth of GOF, then taking the dividends from GOF and investing that into QQQM, VOO, and FSELX.  Going forward all contributions would max out going into GOF, with all dividends then getting put into my other funds.  The idea is we can only contribute a max amount per year, but once the money is in the fund it can generate what ever amount we want.  In theory, all things being equal and according to my rough calculation of GOF's historical data I could be pulling enough dividend from GOF in 3-4 years to fully replace the max IRA contribution, and in about 10 years it would generate more than double the estimated IRA contribution at the time.  That's also years down the road, and roughly halfway between now and retirement.  I understand GOF loses value over time while their yields fluctuate, so I have tried to account for that the best I can in my projections.       2. I can just roll over the $27K into my current fund and just continue to max out my contribution every year going into those funds.       When crunching the numbers between both strategies over the next 25 years the results are quite similar when trying to factor the different fluctuations of GOF, their yield fluctuating, and volatility of the market as a whole. I guess what I am asking for help is - does anyone else use a strategy to similar to strategy 1, or is that just getting overly complex with too many pitfalls for failure?   Should I just continue to yeet the max amount into growth funds until I hit retirement then pivot to dividends?   Or is there a totally different strategy I can look into?",2025-06-09T00:56:57,0
investing,Why I Believe Sweetgreen is Undervalued,"Why I Believe Sweetgreen is Undervalued: A Long-Term Investor‚Äôs Perspective  Since February 21st, 2023, I‚Äôve been steadily accumulating shares of Sweetgreen. My first buy was 106 shares at $9.38, and I currently own¬†3,194.055 shares¬†at an average cost basis of¬†$23.66‚Äîabout¬†$9.61 higher¬†than the current share price. Despite the recent underperformance, I believe Sweetgreen is significantly undervalued relative to where it's headed over the next 5‚Äì10 years. Here's my breakdown of the current state of the business, and why I remain bullish.  # What‚Äôs Going Well  1. Loyalty Program Momentum   Sweetgreen recently launched a revamped rewards program that gives customers 10 points for every $1 spent. They're adding¬†20,000 new members weekly, which gives them the ability to run targeted promotions by customer segment and at the individual level‚Äîan approach proven by other fast-casual chains to lift same-store sales and overall revenue.  2. Infinite Kitchen Expansion   The company plans to open¬†40 new locations in 2025, with¬†at least 20 using Infinite Kitchen automation¬†and one debuting their first¬†drive-thru format. This technology significantly improves:  * Order throughput * Accuracy * Labor efficiency  Early results are compelling:  * Over¬†700 basis points of margin improvement¬†from labor savings * An additional¬†100 basis points¬†in improved cost of goods sold * The first Infinite Kitchen posted a¬†26% restaurant-level margin, far above the company-wide average of¬†20.4%  As more locations convert to this model, margins should continue to expand meaningfully.  3. Well-Positioned Demographic Focus   Sweetgreen‚Äôs core audience‚ÄîMillennials and Gen Z‚Äîcomprise¬†43% of the U.S. population¬†and strongly value health, sustainability, and transparency in food sourcing. This positions Sweetgreen to continue capturing mindshare and loyalty among younger consumers.  4. Resilient Revenue Growth Despite Headwinds   Even amid wildfires in California (a key region for Sweetgreen), reduced marketing spend, and seasonal menu changes, revenue growth remains strong at¬†15%+. That level of top-line expansion, in this macro environment, is a testament to the brand‚Äôs underlying demand.  # What‚Äôs Not Going So Well  1. Same-Store Sales Dip   Same-store sales fell¬†3.1% in Q1 2025, marking their first negative quarter since the 2021 IPO. This is a valid concern‚Äîparticularly as the company relies heavily on new store openings to drive growth. However, several short-term factors likely contributed:  * A transitional period as the new loyalty program rolled out * California wildfires * Reduced marketing and seasonal menu availability  If these headwinds normalize, I expect a return to positive same-store sales in the second half of the year.  2. Portion Size Perception   Anecdotally, a recurring customer complaint across social channels and reviews is that Sweetgreen‚Äôs portion sizes feel small relative to the high prices. The¬†price-per-calorie¬†tends to be lower than competitors, which could hurt repeat visits over time.  That said, the Infinite Kitchen‚Äôs automated portioning should resolve this issue by delivering consistency and transparency in every order. It‚Äôs surprising more fast-casual chains haven‚Äôt adopted smart measuring tools for proteins and toppings to ensure fairness across staff and shifts.  # Long-Term Outlook & Valuation  For long-term investors, Sweetgreen is not just a growth story‚Äîit‚Äôs a¬†compelling valuation play.  * The company trades at just¬†2.1x EV/FY2025 revenue, * Less than half of¬†Chipotle‚Äôs valuation, and * Well below¬†Cava and McDonald‚Äôs, despite similar challenges around same-store sales.  Based on guidance, Sweetgreen expects to end FY2025 with¬†286 locations. At current levels, the business trades at¬†$5.5 million in enterprise value per store.  Compare that to:  * Chipotle: \~$65.6 billion EV / 4,056 stores =¬†$16.2 million EV/store  This gap is stark‚Äîand, in my view, unjustified. Yes, Sweetgreen stores are underperforming right now, but the¬†top-line pressure is industry-wide and likely temporary. Meanwhile, margin improvements via Infinite Kitchens could structurally enhance profitability over time.  If Sweetgreen can:  * Drive increased customer frequency through its loyalty platform * Solve portion perception issues with automation * Expand into higher-volume drive-thru real estate * Launch higher-margin menu innovations (e.g., handhelds, kombucha, add-ons)  ‚Ä¶then I believe the company has the potential to¬†10x in value over the next decade. That implies an $18‚Äì20 billion market cap, which would still be modest compared to Chipotle (\~$70B) and within reach given its trajectory.  Disclosure:   I am currently long Sweetgreen with approximately¬†3,100 shares¬†and¬†October 2024 call options.",2025-06-09T00:16:05,0

investing,"[Sector DD] Deep Dive on the APAC Consumer Discretionary Sector for 2025: Thesis, Financials, and Key Risks","I‚Äôve spent the last few weeks conducting a deep dive into the Asia-Pacific Consumer Discretionary sector for 2025. The landscape is complex, with significant macro headwinds balanced by powerful consumer trends and targeted capital flows. I wanted to share my findings and thesis for discussion.  **Thesis:** Despite a cautious macroeconomic outlook for APAC (IMF projects growth decelerating to 3.9%), fertile ground exists for investors. The key is to look past the macro headlines and focus on specific sub-sectors benefiting from structural tailwinds and the rise of the ""Value-Driven Experientialist"" consumer. Strategic capital inflows and trough-level valuations (vs. the US) suggest a significant opportunity for value realization.  **Part 1: The Bull Case - Key Tailwinds & Consumer Shifts**  While the broad economic picture is cautious, several factors support a bullish thesis for specific areas:  * **Strategic Capital Inflows:** In April 2025, APAC equity ETFs saw **$33.3 billion in inflows**, surpassing both US and European markets. This suggests global investors are actively reallocating capital, likely seeking relative value. * **Consumer Trend 1: The Home as a Hub:** There is a discernible shift towards home-based socializing, entertainment, and wellness. This supports everything from streaming services to home furnishings. * **Consumer Trend 2: Digitally-Enabled Self-Sufficiency:** Consumers are using tech to manage their health, finances, and skills. This creates opportunities for empowering platforms, not just e-commerce. * **Structural Growth:** Rapid urbanization in emerging APAC economies provides a long-term, secular tailwind for home-related spending and the growth of a new middle class.  **Part 2: Company-Specific Financials & Data (Putting the Thesis to the Test)**  To see how these trends play out, I looked at recent financials from key companies across different sub-sectors.  * **1. Automotive Evolution (NIO Inc. - NYSE:NIO):** The EV adoption trend is a clear winner.    * **Q1 2025 Revenue:** RMB 12 billion (**+21.5% YoY**)    * **Q1 Vehicle Sales:** RMB 9.9 billion (**+18.6% YoY**)    * **Q1 Deliveries:** 42,094 smart EVs (**+40.1% YoY**)    * **Vehicle Margin:** 10.2%    * **Commentary:** This demonstrates explosive growth in the EV ecosystem, validating the ""new mobility"" theme. NIO is also expanding infrastructure (power swap stations), building a moat. * **2. Home as a Sanctuary (Sekisui House, Ltd. - TYO:1928):** A proxy for the premium home trend.    * **Q1 FY2025 Revenue:** JPY 894 billion (**Up YoY**)    * **Q1 GAAP EPS:** JPY 51.48 (**Down YoY**)    * **Commentary:** The revenue growth reflects the strong underlying demand from urbanization and home-centric lifestyles. The EPS dip warrants further investigation but highlights that even with strong demand, profitability can be complex. * **3. Education Services Pivot (QuantaSing Group Ltd - NASDAQ:QSG):** Shows the challenges and strategic shifts.    * **Q3 FY2025 Revenue:** RMB 570.7 million    * **Net Income:** RMB 41.1 million    * **Key Event:** Announced a **$20M share buyback**, signaling management confidence in cash flow.    * **Critical Nuance:** Revenue from its core online learning services *declined*. The company is pivoting, acquiring a ""pop toys"" business to move from ""traffic-driven to high-quality growth."" This highlights execution risk and saturation in certain online learning segments.  **Part 3: Legitimate Risks & Headwinds (The Bear Case)**  A balanced view is essential. The key risks to this thesis are:  * **Macroeconomic Slowdown:** The IMF's revised growth forecast of 3.9% for the region is a significant headwind that cannot be ignored. A broader slowdown could impact consumer confidence more than anticipated. * **Geopolitical Tensions:** The ""tariff tightrope walk"" between the US and China remains a major variable. An escalation could disrupt supply chains and depress business investment and consumer spending. * **Inflation & Interest Rates:** A spike in inflation could erode consumer purchasing power for discretionary goods. Higher interest rates also increase borrowing costs for companies, potentially slowing M&A and expansion. * **Execution Risk:** As seen with QuantaSing, companies pivoting their strategy face immense execution risk. Not all will succeed. * **Intense Competition:** The APAC market is not a secret. Competition is fierce from global giants, established local players, and increasingly, aggressive Chinese brands expanding across the ASEAN region.  **Conclusion / TL;DR:**  The APAC Consumer Discretionary sector is a market of stocks, not a stock market. A passive, broad-based approach is risky given the macro headwinds. However, for investors willing to do the work, there are compelling opportunities in specific sub-sectors like EVs, premium home goods, localized streaming, and scalable F&B concepts that are aligned with powerful, long-term consumer and demographic trends.  Happy to discuss this further. What are your thoughts on these themes? Are there other companies or risks on your radar?",2025-06-08T14:56:47,2

People are clearly trading down, and the middle class is feeling the pinch.  Housing: The iShares Home Construction ETF ($ITB) is down ~12% YTD. Housing starts have dropped 1.7% YoY.

I‚Äôm not so certain I want to max out this year because I am taking initial, baby steps to ease into retirement.

I do not plan to take withdraws from my SEP account or other IRA rollover accounts for several more years.¬† The possibility of buying a new home in a LCOL area is the main thing making me hesitate to max out contributions.  Other than the obvious benefit of postponing federal taxes until later, and expectedly in a lower tax environment, what are the pros and cons of using cash from a non-retirement account in place of cash from current income to make SEP contributions?  There are no IRS rules that say the actual dollars one puts in an SEP account have to be the same dollars that come from income. The main rule is you have to have business income to justify the contribution amount.¬†  All my accounts are under one roof, Fidelity. ¬†So, from my point of view I‚Äôd simply be moving dollars from one account, a non tax advantaged account, to an SEP account.¬† One account decreases and another account increases.",2025-06-07T14:32:24,2

investing,Nvidia's 24M shares on Coreweave,"Nvidia's biggest bet of Q1 2025 buying 24 million shares of CoreWeave, a GPU-native cloud provider purpose-built for AI. That stake is worth about $3 billion now. Current price is $147 had it's all time high yesterday at $166.63.  This isn't just another chip sale. It‚Äôs vertical integration in action.    What‚Äôs CoreWeave?  CoreWeave is a cloud company, but not like AWS or Azure. Their entire data center infrastructure is optimized exclusively for AI workloads‚Äîthink LLMs, generative AI, and high-performance compute. And guess whose chips are powering all of it? Nvidia‚Äôs H100s, A100s, and GH200s.  So Nvidia didn‚Äôt just help CoreWeave scale. It bought in.    Nvidia X CoreWeave  2023: Nvidia helped CoreWeave get access to high-demand GPUs.  2024: It helped them expand their data centers.  2025: Nvidia officially became a major shareholder pre-IPO.  CoreWeave went public in March 2025 and the stock has already tripled. Nvidia bought in early, is sitting on massive gains, and now holds strategic influence over one of the fastest-growing AI-native cloud platforms out there.    Why this is different?  Nvidia has made other AI investments‚ÄîARM, Applied Digital, Recursion Pharma, Nebius, WeRide‚Äîbut CoreWeave is the only one they increased in 2025. Others were trimmed. That says a lot about where their conviction lies.  And it‚Äôs easy to see why. CoreWeave isn‚Äôt building general-purpose cloud infrastructure. It‚Äôs building the AI-first cloud-tailored from the ground up to train and deploy models faster and more efficiently than legacy platforms.    Is Coreweave good for long term play?

investing,As CoreWeave's (CRWV) Stock Value Flies - Shareholders Increasingly Turn to Nebius (NBIS) in Shifting AI Cloud Landscape,"The AI infrastructure market is experiencing rapid shifts, and recent developments suggest a potential re-evaluation by investors, with some CoreWeave shareholders reportedly looking towards Nebius as a more compelling opportunity.  While CoreWeave has seen significant stock surges and secured major deals, concerns about its profitability, customer concentration, and unique relationship with Nvidia appear to be prompting some investors to explore alternatives.  CoreWeave, a prominent AI hyperscaler, has undeniably made headlines. Following its IPO in late March 2025 at $40 per share, the company's stock has seen a meteoric rise, at one point surging over 200%. This impressive performance has been fueled by substantial infrastructure agreements, including an $11.2 billion revenue backlog with OpenAI, and continued strong demand for its purpose-built AI platform. Nvidia, a key investor and partner, also recently disclosed a 7% stake in CoreWeave, further boosting investor confidence.  However, a closer look reveals some underlying concerns that may be driving a shift in investor sentiment. Analysts have highlighted CoreWeave's reliance on a limited number of customers, with Microsoft alone accounting for approximately 72% of its revenue in Q1 2025. This customer concentration presents a significant risk, particularly as hyperscalers like Microsoft and Google continue to build out their own AI infrastructure. Furthermore, despite its high revenue growth, CoreWeave reported a net loss of $314.6 million in Q1 2025, raising questions about its path to profitability. The company is also heavily burdened by debt, with some estimates suggesting interest payments could balloon to over $2 billion annually.  Enter Nebius, a rising force in the AI cloud space. Nebius has swiftly positioned itself as a serious contender, focusing on building a global footprint with data centers in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Like CoreWeave, Nebius also boasts a strong partnership with Nvidia, being a launch partner for NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra AI Factory Platform.  What makes Nebius particularly attractive to some investors is its strategic approach to growth and financing. In December 2024, Nebius secured $700 million in equity funding from investors including Accel and Nvidia, followed by a recent $1 billion debt financing round in June 2025. The company's unique financial position, leveraging ownership and equity stakes in non-core businesses like Toloka and ClickHouse, allows it to fund its aggressive expansion plans for its core AI infrastructure business. Nebius has also been actively expanding its data center capacity, recently adding three new regions, including a strategic data center in Israel.  While both CoreWeave and Nebius are aggressively scaling to meet the surging demand for AI infrastructure, Nebius appears to be gaining traction due to its diversified funding strategy, expanding global reach, and potentially more stable long-term outlook. As the AI cloud market continues to evolve, the ability to rapidly deploy capacity, diversify customer bases, and maintain a sound financial footing will be crucial for sustained success. The reported pivot of some CoreWeave shareholders towards Nebius underscores a growing recognition among investors that while immediate growth is appealing, sustainable profitability and strategic diversification are paramount in this fiercely competitive sector.",2025-06-05T13:30:50,12

What would happen if the majority of people choose to heavily save and invest instead of spending money on goods and services on stuff they don't need?  Assume these people automatically buy investments such as broad market index funds. However, the companies they are investing in have poor revenue since people are spending less money in the economy.   I imagine plenty of companies will go out of business. But these people just keep buying the index funds consistently since they were taught to automate their investments.  Would these stocks keep going up anyway since people keep buying and demand is there?   I would imagine this would not be good at all for the overall economy, which is perhaps why schools do not teach this..",2025-06-04T23:35:09,0
investing,Seeking Simple Long-Term Investment Advice,"Hey folks,  I‚Äôm 36 years old, based in Los Angeles, and currently earning about $170K annually. I‚Äôve been trying to take retirement planning seriously, but I still get overwhelmed trying to piece everything together on my own.

That started back in my mid-20s when my grandfather helped me open a Fidelity account (SO GRATEFUL TO HIM!) and he insisted that FXAIX was the only fund I‚Äôd ever need. A couple years ago, I read up on 3-fund portfolio strategies and freaked myself out that I needed to diversify more. So I started dabbling in FTIHX and FXNAX, but the returns seemed underwhelming and I heard some opinions that bonds were not needed if I wasn't close to retirement, so I went back to just contributing to FXAIX.  I didn‚Äôt contribute to a 401(k) until recently since my previous jobs didn‚Äôt offer any match ‚Äî in hindsight, probably not the best move. Now that I'm contributing to one to get my company match, I'll try to put more here after I max my Roth IRA though.   # Where I Need Advice:  * Is it unwise to keep my Roth IRA almost entirely in FXAIX at this point? * Is it unwise to have the same mutual funds in a TBA and a Roth IRA?  * Should I be adding more international exposure (FTIHX or something else) to balance things out while staying fairly growth-oriented? * Are there any other low-fee funds you‚Äôd recommend that could diversify my portfolio a bit more without overcomplicating things?

investing,How does one build a conservative portfolio in this economic environment?,"I am of the opinion that tariffs are (eventually) going to have a negative impact on the economy, so I want to rebalance my portfolio to protect against this possibility, in the short term.  I have been researching different options, and had the idea to look at the period between March 2021 and June 2022, when YoY inflation rose from 2% to 9.1%.   Here are some of the options I looked at (ticker - current dividend, % change from 3/21 to 6/22)  1. SGOV - 4.18%, 0%  2. FLOT - 4.87%, 1.4% decrease   3. DBC - 0%, 60% increase  4. XLE - 3.40%, 46% increase  5. SPSB - 4.56%, 5% decrease  6. SCHD - 3.96%, 1.8% decrease   7. SUB - 2.95%, 2.9% decrease  8. OXY - 2.21%, 124% increase   As far as I can tell, SGOV is the safest option‚Ä¶ and investing in energy and commodities ETFs would be the best play if you were absolutely certain inflation was going to occur (with oil being the best, but oil is subject to a lot of different pressures that are unpredictable).  At this point I am thinking 80%-90% SGOV with 10-20% in commodities/energy. But I do worry that putting that much in SGOV isn‚Äôt diversified enough, even though the risk of SGOV collapsing is almost zero.   What do you guys think of this? Am I insane? Is this a rational plan?",2025-06-04T22:03:15,8

investing,Advice Needed: What is an investment equivalent to Whole Life Insurance?,"I am late to the game and recently started building retirement and opened up a SEP IRA and Roth IRA with fidelity. My yearly plan is to max my Roth IRA and contribute as much as possible in to my SEP IRA.  Also, recently, I had a meeting with a friend who just got a job with Northwestern Mutual as a financial advisor, and her supervisor. The supervisor came up with a short plan of paying off my debt, purchasing a T20 Life insurance, and disability insurance.  She then mentioned that a long term plan would be purchasing whole life insurance for a way of having money growing in an account that is not taxed and can be taken out in emergencies. The sale point was what if you have an emergency and the market is down and you don't want to take money out of your IRA's if the market is down. This obviously sounds ideal because life is unpredictable, BUT I just can't buy into paying $500 a month for whole life insurance for 5.5% dividend for a potential ""emergency"" where I would be able to take cash assets that would accumulate slowing. I also researched whole life insurance and it just doesn't make sense for me and my situation (no kids-won't have kids and no spouse-TBD). I already have term life insurance- $5/month, small amount to cover after death costs.  **My question is, what are other options for her proposed scenario of having an account that isn't embedded in the stock market and accumulates money?

investing,Argument for the P/E ratio new paradigm,"This is pure intuitive speculation, I will appreciate all corrections and counter arguments! :)    Current P/E ratios for the US large and ultra-large cap stocks are very high and looking back at history, many people (myself included) wonder if it's still worth it to keep passively investing in them. It appears that the P/E ratios are 'out of balance' and will have to come back down sooner than later. This would supposedly most likely happen by P going down.    I am well aware of bubbles, talk of new paradigms, confirmation bias, irrational exuberence and all that good and valid jazz.    Despite that, I can't help but feel like there are trends causing inflows of money into assets to increase and compound over time, trends which likely explain recent (decade) huge price increases and will likely continue into the future, further 'skewing' asset valuations and P/E ratios.   More people are buying assets than ever. Demand for assets, return on invesfment is increasing. Rich people get richer, want to spend their money to get richer, and number of rich people is increasing. For example, Amrericans' stock ownership is at an ATH. https://kanebridgenews.com/more-americans-than-ever-own-stocks/ I suspect a similar picture for the entire world for all asset classes. Demand for assets is increasing faster than supply of assets.*   Global GDP continues to grow, likely reflecting rising disposable incomes, purchasing power. Due to  diminishing returns' on consumption, more and more people allocate more and more of their disposable income to investments/assets (crude example: once all billionaires get 3 superyachts, most will not want to buy a 4th, instead they will have to put their money somewhere else. Most attractive option for spare money are assetd. There are only so many consumables to go around and the demand for them is not infinite unlike demand for returns on investment aka assets (and blue chip stocks are some of the most attractive assets).   Share of incomes going into investments increasing, means share of incomes going into consumption decreases. Consumption roughly is E. Company earnings are not keeping up because people consume fewer and fewer of their products instead opting to put more money into their shares (for example, there is more demand for Tesla shares than Tesla cars, if I may say so). This seems like a very rational decision on the individuals' part and ever reflectd common financial advice.   So, assuming demand for money stays as high as now (likely because humans evolved to want more resources than everyone around them), these trends will continue. Thus we would expect in the long term stock valuations to keep increasing (obviously with short term violatility) even without corresponding increase in their earnings.    * For example it's much easier to simply earn money with a job than to create a company providing jobs. Automation. It's easier to earn enough to buy an asset than to build one?   Thoughts?   P.S. apologies for poor writing and any mistakes.",2025-06-04T16:01:21,3

StockMarket,Is the AI Frenzy Far from Over? Which Concept Stocks Are Reaching New Highs?,"There has been a chart circulating online comparing the stock trends of Cisco vs. Nvidia. The sharp decline in $NVIDIA (NVDA.US)$'s stock price at the beginning of the year brings back memories of Cisco in the 1990s. After the burst of the dot-com bubble, companies like $Cisco (CSCO.US)$ and $Intel (INTC.US)$ saw their stock prices plummet. Investors want to know if Nvidia will face the same fate.  However, there has been a new twist in this chart. On April 30th, a pivot occurred with Microsoft's earnings; Nvidia also continued its upward trend when it announced a series of contracts from the Middle East.  The quarterly earnings released by Microsoft sends a clear message: the AI juggernaut rolls on, at least for now. Since the earnings release, Microsoft's stock price has soared over 17%. This news has been comforting to the entire AI sector, proving that companies are not disappointed in this highly hyped technology. Microsoft's strong performance has also led the market to infer an increased demand for Nvidia chips.  Additionally, with Trump and bin Salman endorsing the US-Saudi AI deal, Nvidia said it will sell hundreds of thousands of AI chips in Saudi Arabia, with a first tranche of 18,000 of its newest ""Blackwell"" chips going to Humain, an AI startup just launched by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. Nvidia's stock price has recovered from its sharp decline at the beginning of the year.  **Is the AI frenzy far from over?**  Recent trends in AI concept stocks indicate that the AI ""stock market fuel"" is far from running out. On Monday, $Applied Digital (APLD.US)$ announced a transformative $7 billion, 15-year AI data center lease agreement with $CoreWeave (CRWV.US)$, a leading AI hyperscaler. Applied Digital saw its stock price skyrocket by 48.46%, closing at $10.14. Meanwhile, CoreWeave's stock has more than doubled since the start of the year.  $Tempus AI (TEM.US)$, a ""precision medicine"" company that leverages artificial intelligence to better treat patients, Shares soared 15% on Monday. Late Friday, the company announced an initiative it calls Fuses, a program designed to transform therapeutic research and build the largest diagnostic platform using its novel foundation model. Since the beginning of the year, Tempus AI's stock has surged by 88%, while the telehealth firms $Hims & Hers Health (HIMS.US)$ has skyrocketed nearly 135%.  **$Palantir (PLTR.US)$'s stock price has also continued to reach new highs, rising 74% since the beginning of the year. The up-and-coming AI firm $BGM is up over 88% so far this year.**  Furthermore, $Broadcom (AVGO.US)$ will release its second-quarter financial report after the market closes on June 5th. Wall Street expects the chipmaker to report growing revenue and profits fueled by demand for AI chips. Broadcom may soon become the first big tech stock to break historical highs. Its current stock price is $248.71, just under 1% lower than the peak of $250.45 in December last year.",2025-06-11T13:56:33,0

The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. means Trump may continue to enforce, for now, his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on imports from most U.S. trading partners, as well as a separate set of tariffs levied on Canada, China and Mexico.  The appeals court has yet to rule on whether the tariffs are permissible under an emergency economic powers act that Trump cited to justify them, but it allowed the tariffs to remain in place while the appeals play out.  The tariffs, used by Trump as negotiating leverage with U.S. trading partners, and their on-again, off-again nature have shocked markets and whipsawed companies of all sizes as they seek to manage supply chains, production, staffing and prices.  The ruling has no impact on other tariffs levied under more traditional legal authority, such as tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.  A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled on May 28 that the U.S. Constitution gave Congress, not the president, the power to levy taxes and tariffs, and that the president had exceeded his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law intended to address ""unusual and extraordinary"" threats during national emergencies.  The Trump administration quickly appealed the ruling, and the Federal Circuit in Washington put the lower court decision on hold the next day while it considered whether to impose a longer-term pause.  The ruling came in a pair of lawsuits, one filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small U.S. businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties and the other by 12 U.S. states.  Trump has claimed broad authority to set tariffs under IEEPA. The 1977 law has historically been used to impose sanctions on enemies of the U.S. or freeze their assets. Trump is the first U.S. president to use it to impose tariffs.  Trump has said that the tariffs imposed in February on Canada, China and Mexico were to fight illegal fentanyl trafficking at U.S. borders, denied by the three countries, and that the across-the-board tariffs on all U.S. trading partners imposed in April were a response to the U.S. trade deficit.  The states and small businesses had argued the tariffs were not a legal or appropriate way to address those matters, and the small businesses argued that the decades-long U.S. practice of buying more goods than it exports does not qualify as an emergency that would trigger IEEPA.  At least five other court cases have challenged the tariffs justified under the emergency economic powers act, including other small businesses and the state of California. One of those cases, in federal court in Washington, D.C., also resulted in an initial ruling against the tariffs, and no court has yet backed the unlimited emergency tariff authority Trump has claimed.",2025-06-11T00:33:22,137
StockMarket,Navitas Semiconductor : From 2 dollars to 8 dollars ...,"**Hi everyone,**  I know this company that was recommended on subreddits focused on smXXl cxps.

Its projected annual revenue figure based on current revenue data, which was about $5.5 billion in December 2024, has demonstrated strong growth as the adoption and use of its popular ChatGPT artificial-intelligence models continue to rise.  This means OpenAI is on track to achieve its revenue target of $12.7 billion in 2025, which it had shared with investors earlier.  The $10 billion figure excludes licensing revenue from OpenAI-backer Microsoft and large one-time deals, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed. The details were first reported by CNBC.  Considering the startup lost about $5 billion last year, OpenAI's revenue milestone shows how far ahead the company is in revenue scale compared to its competitors, which are also benefiting from growing AI adoption.  Anthropic recently crossed $3 billion in annualized revenue on booming demand from code-gen startups using its models.  OpenAI said in March it would raise up to $40 billion in a new funding round led by SoftBank Group, at a $300 billion valuation.  In more than two years since it rolled out its ChatGPT chatbot, the company has introduced a bevy of subscription offerings for consumers as well as businesses.

StockMarket,AMZN + ASTS = Global Sovereign Connectivity and Cloud Services,"I've been thinking about some recent news, and I need to share this theory because it feels big for AST SpaceMobile ($ASTS). This is just me connecting some dots, but it looks like something major could be brewing between them and Amazon.  First, just this past Monday, Jeff Bezos met with Abel Avellan, the CEO of ASTS and Adriana Cisneros, the first major ASTS investor. Adriana later posted saying ""amazing things are happening at ASTS and Blue Origin, congrats Abel and Jeff!"" That alone is a pretty big deal ‚Äì Bezos doesn't usually make those kinds of public appearances for nothing.  **Then, literally the next day, Amazon drops news about launching a completely new, ""Sovereign Cloud"" business in Europe.**¬†What that means is it's a super secure cloud, totally separate, managed entirely by EU citizens within the EU, designed for governments and super sensitive data. It‚Äôs built for total control and independence for European clients.¬†**Now, about a month ago, ASTS and Vodafone announced their own joint venture in Europe, called SatCo. And guess what they heavily emphasized? ""Sovereignty.""**¬†This venture aims to provide 100% cellular coverage across Europe using ASTS's satellites, designed with European control and ""sovereign backhaul capabilities"" for both commercial and government use.  See the pattern? ASTS launched a ""sovereign"" solution specifically for Europe targeting governments and critical industries, and then RIGHT after the meeting with Jeff Bezos, Amazon/AWS announces a similar sovereign solution for Europe. That doesn't just happen randomly.¬†**To me, it screams that these companies are talking, strategizing, and probably planning to work together to create an end-to-end ""sovereign"" digital solution.**  If Amazon's secure ""Sovereign Cloud"" needs ubiquitous, reliable, and sovereign connectivity everywhere in Europe (especially where cell towers can't reach, or for emergencies), then ASTS's ""Sovereign SatCo"" is the perfect, ready-made solution. Plus, it's no secret Bezos wants to compete with Elon Musk in space.¬†**Starlink struggles with direct-to-phone, but ASTS has that tech locked down. Starlink struggles with respecting digital sovereignty in Europe--and is even a threat to digital sovereignty after what we saw in Ukraine and Russia. ASTS has the Solution, and Jeff Bezos/Amazon/AWS want to take advantage.**  My guess?¬†**Amazon is looking to capitalize in this blatant weakness in Elon Musk's Starlink stretegy.**¬†Amazon will integrate ASTS's unique satellite-to-phone network into its AWS offerings, especially for these high-stakes sovereign clients.¬†**It makes total sense for Amazon to partner with ASTS to offer a complete, end-to-end ""sovereign"" digital solution, from the cloud to your phone, anywhere in Europe.**¬†If this happens, it's huge for ASTS and Amazon.

With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.  Trump‚Äôs tariffs¬†will be a key topic in Friday‚Äôs consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before¬†leveling out in May. Consumers are¬†consistently worried¬†that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom.  # This Week‚Äôs Calendar  **Monday, June 9**  * Wholesale inventories (April) * Apple‚Äôs (AAPL) WWDC conference begins with CEO Tim Cook's keynote address and special event * Key Earnings: Casey‚Äôs General Stores (CASY)  **Tuesday, June 10**  * NFIB Small Business Optimism Index (May) * Key Earnings: J.M.

StockMarket,"Week Recap: Tesla lost more than 14% this week. The S&P 500 closed 6,000 after dropping below that level on February 21. Is it on the road to a new all-time high? June 2, 2025 ‚Äì June 6, 2025","First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from May. 30 to June 6.   In general, this week came a lot of key data about the job market and the results were mixed. If there hadn't been any debate between Trump and Elon Musk, we might have closed the week with 5 green days. However, the stock market shifted focus to that story after Thursday. Our agenda remains similar to previous weeks: tariffs, debt concerns, and rate cut decisions.  Here are the S&P 500's week-by-week results,  Mar. 28 close at 5,580.94 - Apr. 4 close at 5,074.08 üî¥  Apr. 4 close at 5,074.08 - Apr. 11 close at 5,358.75 üü¢  Apr. 11 close at 5,358.75 - Apr. 25 close at 5,523.52 üü¢  Apr. 25 close at 5,358.75 - May. 2 close at 5,686.67 üü¢  May. 2 close at 5,686.67 - May. 9 close at 5,659.91 üî¥  May. 9 close at 5,659.91 - May. 16 close at 5,957.63 üü¢ (+5.26%)  May. 16 close at 5,957.63 - May. 23 close at 5,802.82 üî¥ (-2.59%)  May. 23 close at 5,802.82 - May. 30 close at 5,911.69 üü¢ (+1.87%)  May. 30 close at 5,911.69 - June 6 close at 6,000.36 üü¢ (+1.49%)  üî∏ Monday: This week began with tariffs concern again. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalated. Trump announced new steel tariffs. On the other hand, Fed's Waller said tariffs are likely cause a one-time price increase and 10% tariff can get inflation up to 3%. As results, the stock market opened slighly lower. Both sides allegations each other of violating a trade-war truce. By the end of the day, the stock market recovered loses and closed higher. üü¢  üî∏ Tuesday: The U.S. extended the tariff pause on some Chinese goods to August 31. The stock market reached positively and opened higher. Job openings data was released and came in slightly higher above expectations and last month, but it still below the average for the year. The tariff pause news boosted semiconductor stocks and they helping to lift the indexes. The S&P500 closed higher. üü¢  üî∏ Wednesday: Several key datas released about job market in this week and it came mixed. The ADP Nonform Employment Change showed only 37K new jobs and the lowest level since February 2022. However, Trump mentioned plans to speak with Xi. For the markets, tariff concerns remained the most important things. The stock market opened slightly higher. On the commodities side, gold declined again $3,380. The stock market closed higher, but the S&P 500 gained only 0.01% and extended winning streak to 3-day. üü¢  üî∏ Thursday: Geopolitical risks continued to rise. Trump announced a full travel ban on 12 countries and partial restrictions on 7 others. Weekly continuing jobless claims were released and reached 247K that the highest level since November 2024. Trump and Xi held phone call though no details were disclosed. The stock market opened slightly higher. During the session, silver broken the $34 level after 10-week and surged to $36 that the highest level since February 2012. Another major issue emerged for the market that public debate between Trump and Elon Musk. Tesla shares plunged more than 14% in a single day. This issue dragged the stock market lower and closed. By the way, European Central Bank cut interest rates by 25 points in eighth consecutive cut. üî¥  üî∏ Friday: Nonfarm Payrolls data was released and came in higher than expected. The stock market opened up more than 0.5%. Trump announced that meeting with Chinese officials on June 9 in London. This gave the market a slight boost and it closed up more than 1%. As a result, the S&P 500 closed at 6,000. üü¢  6,000 level is a major psychological threshold for investors. In the 5,000 levels, there were many news of hedge fund managers sold their positions. They had look to very negative outlook on the market. After that points, news about Europe surprised and those investors missed the rally. They're now waiting for a correction to enter, but the stock market has not given any opportunity so far. If they give up waiting and start buying, could we reach a new all-time high?

StockMarket,Rocket mortgage market hedge,"I‚Äôve posted about this company before..was wondering if it has caught on a little. This is a pure play interest rate market hedge. The idea is when the rates drop the refinance boom happens..it was unclear to a lot whether the fed would drop rates or even RAISE rates.   At this point all most all data I look at point to we are going down..the fed WILL have to lower rates. Just a matter of how fast and how deep.   Recently the market cheered the jobs report but all 4 have been revised down SIGNIFICANTLY this year. After this revision (a small assumption) it will be a huge Miss. and what‚Äôs the next jobs report after tarrifs keep taking effect? 100,000?   People are struggling bad..and companies can‚Äôt pass the prices so they have to do layoffs to saves themselves.   We did fortunately just gave a high interest rate housing boom..as the fed lowers rates historically every time the 10 year follows and stock market collapse as companies get weaker ect. People flock to bonds. They still will. There‚Äôs no other place to put the money the world is already in recession. Every bank is lowering and lowering.   My play my god if this works..is rocket mortgage should climb to at least a double but citron calls for $33.   Then migrate that into the crash of the stock market.

This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.  News: [Musk Blinks First in Bitter Trump Feud That Cost Him $34 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-06/musk-blinks-first-in-bitter-trump-feud-that-cost-him-34-billion)  [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Elon Musk/Trump were in a public feud/argument on Twitter yesterday, and the threat of TSLA's government contracts being cancelled was brought up by Trump. Looking for the second day trade in this- we saw TSLA go to a low of $275 yesterday, so I'm interested to see if we continue selling off or make at least some attempt at recovery. Trump/Musk are expected to speak today to ""cool things down"". This spat is mainly political, another issue to add along with the rest. Musk did threaten to stop work on the Dragon Capsule, Trump threatened to stop all of TSLA/SpaceX's government contracts, causing the stock to fall 50 points throughout the day.  https://preview.redd.it/ij1emaza4b5f1.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=014b8026d5ae129804b3ffa6c76b08904e612fc9  [**VERA (Vera)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VERA&p=d)\- VERA fell 30% after competitor Otsuka reported superior Phase 3 trial results for its IgA nephropathy drug, sibeprenlimab, which achieved a 51.2% reduction in proteinuria compared to Vera's atacicept's 46% reduction. We had seen VERA actually spike up due to their drug report a few days back from $20 ->$37 on this news- it's possible that it'll just stay flat at pre-drug release price.  https://preview.redd.it/q9kkz9ac4b5f1.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=f33f500c60402e94152237c3f7da6d4198d8938a  [**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\- Watching the $100 level for potential breakout or breakdown. I regret not writing a DD for this but I was taking a break. We opened at \~2.5x multiple to the original IPO price and surged past $100 briefly in the first few minutes of trading, we've stayed pretty strong/sustained up since then. I'm interested to see if we can stay fairly at this level. I'm mainly interested in this because CRCL is one of the first listed stable C's on a US listing, and we've seen HUGE interest in recent catalysts that are related to this space/industry.  https://preview.redd.it/km89929e4b5f1.png?width=1530&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfe3d8c062508cf0f923c7ad4a4ad09044921570  [**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\- ASTS surged over 13% amid speculation of a potential partnership or investment from Amazon, following social media posts featuring AST's CEO and Jeff Bezos. AMZN is beginning commercialization of its Project Kuiper initiative, a satellite-based project that will deliver retail wireless broadband to Earth (competitor to Starlink). There was a research report released that speculates ASTS's RF wireless service could complement Kuiper's broadband technology, and therefore make sense for an acquisition by AMZN. Regardless of how plausible you think an acquisition this is, this was driven all by a single picture and speculation. So be careful of volatility if nothing happens.  https://preview.redd.it/h11otmof4b5f1.png?width=1525&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb62141022a4c0a8ee0d1c24f7d26429c2236314",2025-06-06T13:15:48,11

StockMarket,"Scott Besant, Howard Lutnick, and Jamison Greer Three U.S. Cabinet officials at one point in the trade talks with Japan put the talks on hold and started a debate in front of Japanese negotiators","TOKYO -- The presence of three top U.S. negotiators with differing stances on trade is adding a layer of complexity to tariff talks with Japan.  Open disagreements, competition and confusion among Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer have made it hard for the Japanese side to judge the¬†[Trump administration](https://archive.ph/o/Xn6Ey/https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Trump-administration)'s intentions, according to sources close to the negotiations.  **""At one point, the three cabinet officials put the talks with the Japanese side on hold and began debating right in front of them,"" said one source.**  **""The three officials are competing for credit,"" said another source close to the Japanese government who speculates** that they may be trying to curry favor with President Donald Trump.

""I'm very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people,"" Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. ""All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to have to cut the EV mandate.""  ""Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore. I was surprised,"" Trump added.  Tesla stock fell to session lows on Thursday afternoon as Musk reacted in real-time to Trump's comments, falling over 11% near 2:45 p.m. ET.  Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns, in¬†apparent response¬†to Trump's comments: ""Whatever."" He continued aiming at the president and the bill in a subsequent barrage of posts over several hours.  That prompted another response from Trump, who posted on Truth Social, the platform that he owns. Trump said he ""asked"" must to leave his government post, charging that he was ""wearing thin."" He also seemed to question the purpose of Musk's department.  ""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon‚Äôs Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn‚Äôt do it!"" Trump wrote.  Trump's comments amounted to an extraordinary public rebuke of Musk, who went from Trump booster and Republican Party megadonor during the 2024 campaign, to the head of the Trump-created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with a mission to cut spending.  Musk kicked off the¬†complaints over the bill earlier this week, calling it a ""disgusting abomination"" on Tuesday. The billionaire ramped up his barbs on Wednesday, telling users on X to, ""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.""  The Wall Street Journal¬†also reported¬†that the strain between the two was amplified by the White House's move to nix the nomination of Jared Isaacman for NASA administrator. Musk, a close ally of Isaacman, had advocated for him to get the job, sources told the Journal.  Bloomberg reported that Musk's ire may also be directed at the fact that the¬†federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.  The Big Beautiful Bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, with a¬†Congressional Budget Office estimation¬†of its impact on the deficit adding fuel to Musk's line of argument.  The nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.  DOGE itself, once led by Musk, has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find ‚Äî and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.  Musk's ties to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for his broader business interests, given SpaceX's close work with NASA and regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.  But demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing¬†some Tesla owners to become alienated¬†by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.  Tesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.  Meanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG,¬†GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating¬†250,000 robotaxi trips per week.",2025-06-05T19:06:01,839

StockMarket,"Goodbye to 8,000 jobs - IBM replaces workers with artificial intelligence, sparking a wave of global reactions","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is here to stay, that much we know, but in recent weeks a very frustrating news item has been making the rounds: the catastrophic future in which machines replace humans has arrived. IBM, one of the most important technology companies in the world, has eliminated approximately 8,000 jobs within the Human Resources (HR) Department. Why? You can probably guess: AI has taken over everything.  The ‚Äúrepetitive‚Äù jobs, reading vacation requests, managing payroll or internal company documentation will now be handled by AI systems, like the AskHR platform. Are we facing the future or a step backward?  And as we were saying, the AskHR platform is currently managing 94% of the routine tasks that would normally be done by humans in the HR department, everything involving paperwork, documentation‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs history, now AI takes care of it.",2025-06-05T15:19:21,2911

StockMarket,"The iShares Defense Industrials Active ETF (IDEF) is the BEST, most diversified defense sector ETF available, is actively managed, has the most robust and niche holdings unavailable in other defense ETFs. Read on for my assessment why if you are into defense, this should not be slept on.","One of the themes of 2025 has been Defense ETFs with the geopolitical tensions in the world today which saw the rise of Europe Defense ETFs earlier this year that diversified away from US defense ETFs. With BlackRock/iShares latest offering (IDEF), I document my reasons why I think IDEF should be a *must-have* for investors who want an ***actively managed and diversified investment in the Global defense sector.***  # Context:  * Prior to the launch of IDEF, there were only a several defense ETFs available for US investors which were also aerospace heavy (e.g. Boeing). * The prominent ETFs which have had good performance are SHLD (Global X Defense Tech ETF) and for non-US investors, there was also DFNS (VanEck Defense UCITS ETF USD A). * Recently, there have been EU-centric ETFs that came to prominence with the increased EU spending, such as EUAD (Select STOXX Europe Aerospace & Defense ETF), NATO (HANEtf The Global Defence ETF) and several others.  # The cons of the above:  1. Many of these ETFs have large concentration in aerospace companies rather than defense companies (e.g. Boeing), 2. Many of these also bloat with cybersecurity companies rather than defense companies (e.g. Crowdstrike, Palo Alto, Cisco), 3. High concentration and limited holdings. Particularly with the EU defense, you see high concentration in one to three companies (e.g. Rheinmetall, Thales, BAE, etc) which each hold an average of 10-15% weight in the portfolio, while ETFs such as DFNS are concentrated in 20-30 holdings, 4. With the prominence of Palantir, it also holds a high concentration in these ETFs of around 7-10%.  # What makes IDEF better and more well diversified:  1. It has approximately 120+ holdings, higher than any other Defense ETF, 2. The fund is actively managed, unlike majority of others which just track an index of companies thrown together to fit a theme, 3. Portfolio has exposure to South Korea, France, UK, Japan, Germany, Israel, Italy, Sweden, Canada, Australia, Singapore. The highest weight is just under 6% of all holdings (GE AEROSPACE, 5.58% as of 3 June) 4. The portfolio has the usual defense favorites such as Palantir, Thales, Rheinmetall, Rolls-Royce, Airbus and many more, 5. The portfolio also includes gems and companies that serve national defense infrastructure like Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd (Singapore - 70% YTD), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (Japan - 48% YTD), DroneShield Ltd (Australia - 117% YTD), 6. The portfolio also includes small exposures to potential high growth companies like Rocket Lab Inc, Archer Aviation, C3.ai, Redwire, Bigbear.ai, 7. Expense ratio is 0.55% which is in-line with other Defense ETFs but considered low when you consider this is actively managed compared to those that passively track an index or basket of companies.  # Downsides to the ETF:  * While this is currently the ETF which is the most diversified and has a large number of holdings, it is still US heavy at 59%. * Being iShares/BlackRock, feels like there will always be the usual suspects such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin included. * Current volume is low as the fund was only incepted on 19 May 2025, less than a month ago.  # How to address the downsides:  * To balance out the US heavy concentration, consider supplementing together with an EU defense ETF if you want more exposure to EU and less to US. There is no Asia/Oceanic ETF at the moment. * To balance out the Boeing/Lockheed holdings, consider supplementing together with SHLD which does not hold these, and is arguably the 2nd best defense ETF available on the market.

StockMarket,"$LIN in times of news induced volatility can be a good stock, imo","In my personal opinion, this type of steady growth company specially in this current type of volatile situation is very important stock to look at. The business is very good.      It has been trading in specific range for quite some time, testing both resistance and support, but this time I believe a huge breakout of resistance is going to happen making ATH.      The reversal from support range have been very very strong.  My Technical POV:      1. The support price of $424 has been tested a lot, but a strong rejection is there almost every time the price tests the support, for example in Apr '25      2. Whereas in the resistance range, the testing and reversal is slow      3. In 2022-2023, similar range price action was seen, but after a breakout a steady uptrend occurred, I am speculating same thing to happen if a breakout in current range happens  https://preview.redd.it/1k8c39llx25f1.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb5edb3b1c1a0ac9db48acff3dfab0b96e946a61  https://preview.redd.it/m2zqv0kmx25f1.png?width=1564&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1342deb7e65de23e8f01cdefde08fbf9393752",2025-06-05T09:43:18,7

StockMarket,Shiny Rocks Not Stocks - Financial Repression and the Bull Case for Metals,"THE DEBT PROBLEM  The U.S. government has a debt problem. With debt-to-GDP levels approaching those last seen during World War II, and the largest twin deficit in U.S. history, we‚Äôre borrowing the illusion of prosperity with no real path to pay it back.  Every administration since Reagan has expanded deficits and financed them with debt, all while exporting inflation to developing nations through the ‚ÄúKing Dollar‚Äù system and exploiting cheap labor abroad.  Now, debt levels are reaching extremes. Inflation remains sticky, and government revenues can‚Äôt keep pace with rising interest payments. The conditions are ripe for a return to financial repression‚Äîand with it, a global repricing of everything.  FINANCIAL REPRESSION  Definition: Keeping interest rates (yields) below the rate of inflation in order to quietly erode the real value of debt. Translation: Inflate your way out‚Äîwithout telling anyone that‚Äôs the plan.  We‚Äôve seen this playbook before. In the post-WWII era, financial repression was used to whittle down a massive federal debt load. It worked, but only because savers took the hit, real returns were crushed, and capital was locked inside the system.  INFLATION COMES IN TWOS‚ÄîAND SO DOES FINANCIAL REPRESSION  In Charts 1 and 2, you can see that every time real yields turned negative (i.e., inflation was higher than the 10-year Treasury yield), a second wave of inflation followed.  Each of these second waves saw real yields go deeper into negative territory‚Äîand commodities outperformed equities, as seen in the GOLD/SPX ratio.  We already saw the first wave in 2020. Real yields hit historic lows after the fastest rate cuts in history collided with a global economic shutdown. The Fed panicked, inflation collapsed, and markets sighed in relief. But if history‚Äôs any guide, that was just round one.  We aren‚Äôt out of the woods. The second wave is often even worse.  THE GOLD/SILVER RATIO (GSR)  The gold/silver ratio is flashing a major signal. Gold has dramatically outperformed silver, with the ratio spiking back above 100.  Historically, the GSR hasn‚Äôt spent sustained time above 97. Each time we‚Äôve entered a second inflation wave paired with financial repression, this ratio has corrected sharply‚Äîwith silver catching up violently to gold.  This setup looks eerily similar to those previous cycles. Gold has moved first. Silver may be next, but this time it‚Äôs jumping from the roof with no parachute ü™Ç   TLDR Shiny rocks not stocks.

wallstreetbetsGER,RKBL Analyse,"Hallo zusammen,  ich wei√ü nicht genau ob das hier auf die richtigen Leute st√∂√üt aber ich m√∂chte gerne meine Idee mit euch teilen. Ich wei√ü das das Unternehmen Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKBL, NASDAQ) ein bereits bekanntes Unternehmen ist. Dennoch w√ºrde ich meine Analyse gerne mit euch teilen um auch andere Meinungen und eventuell identische Meinungen austauschen zu k√∂nnen und d√ºrfen:  Zun√§chst einmal ist RKBL ein f√ºhrendes Unternehmen in der Kleintr√§gerraketen Infrastruktur und geh√∂rt mit den der erfolgreichen Electron-Rakete zu den erfolgreichen und kosteneffizienten Kontrahenten von zb. SpaceX. Der heutige Dip und die generelle Volatilit√§t sind f√ºr mich ein Hinweis auf ein gutes Start up und ein stetiges Interesse an der Aktie. Der Umsatz ist stark gestiegen (+35% YoY) jedoch ist die EBITDA-Marge noch verlustbringend. Die Verschuldung ist moderat jedoch √ºber Anleihen gedeckt und tragf√§hig bei weiterem Wachstum.   In den letzten 24 Tagen f√ºhrte RKBL 3 erfolgreiche Starts durch und sorgte damit f√ºr eine hohe operative Zuverl√§ssigkeit, auch bei Investoren. Zudem kamen neue Gro√üauftr√§ge, wie der erste Multi Launch Vertrag √ºber vier Electron Starts f√ºr iQPS, geplant f√ºr 2025. Zudem ist der Launch der neuen Neutron Rakete f√ºr 2025 geplant. Damit w√ºrde RKBL ebenfalls in den Bereich Mitteltr√§gerraketen gehen. Ebenfalls gab es erfolgreiche Deals mit der US Regierung (US space force, Air Force) zu Test Fl√ºgen (HASTE Hypersonic Test Programm).   Neben den Technischen Projekten ist das Unternehmen auch intern in guten H√§nden. CEO Peter Beck ist selbst Raumfahrtpionier und √ºberzeugte erfolgreich Investoren. Zudem Adam Spice (CFO), Shane Fleming (VP) und weitere.   RKBL plant weitere Starts f√ºr 25/26 und vor allem den erst Flug der neuen Neutron Rakete. Ebenfalls gibt es laufende Deals mit der NASA, dem Pentagon bzw. dem Milit√§r. Zudem erweiterte das Unternehmen seine F√§higkeit mit der √úbernahme von GEOST. Auch die Startpl√§tze werden international ausgebaut.   Sollte der Testflug dieses Jahr erfolgreich verlaufen und die Deals ebenfalls, d√ºrfte das Unternehmen ein Etablierter Charakter in der Raumfahrtindustrie werden. Sollte dieser Testflug aber erfolgreich verlaufen dann d√ºrfte dies die T√ºren f√ºr Multi Milliarden Deals √∂ffnen.   Ich wei√ü das es hoch riskant ist, ich selbst habe jedoch viel investiert weil ich an das Unternehmen in Zukunft glaube. Ich gehe davon aus das das Unternehmen in Zukunft sehr erfolgreich werden wird, und daher w√ºrde mich interessieren ob ihr genauso denkt. Teilt gerne eure Meinung mit mir.

Hyperschall macht europ√§ische Entfernungen zu einer Frage von Minuten  Es gibt kein Ost und West mehr. Nur noch die NATO.  Rutte: Wir brauchen eine 400-prozentige Aufstockung der Luft- und Raketenabwehr. Die Ukraine zeigt Russlands Terror aus der Luft.  Die NATO wird ihren Schutzschild, ihre Panzer, Granaten, Logistik, Kriegsschiffe, Drohnen und Langstreckenraketen verst√§rken. Wir werden √ºber 700 F-35 kaufen. Auch die Investitionen in Weltraum und Cybersicherheit werden steigen.  Rutte: Russland zeigt kein Interesse an Frieden ‚Äì Russland greift t√§glich Zivilisten in der Ukraine an. Das ist Gewalt um der Gewalt willen.  Wir unterst√ºtzen Trumps Bem√ºhungen, das Blutvergie√üen zu beenden. Die NATO steht hinter der Ukraine, um ihr zu helfen, sich jetzt zu verteidigen und k√ºnftige Aggressionen abzuschrecken.  Rutte: Die Europ√§er sollten den Fernseher ausschalten und Pr√§sident Trump zuh√∂ren. Die USA stehen voll und ganz hinter der NATO, aber sie haben auch Erwartungen.  Europa und Kanada m√ºssen mit den Ausgaben der USA Schritt halten. Wir brauchen 3,5 % des BIP f√ºr Verteidigung, um die F√§higkeitsziele zu erreichen.  Rutte: Russlands Wirtschaft befindet sich im totalen Kriegszustand. Die Wirtschaft der NATO ist 25-mal gr√∂√üer ‚Äì 50 Billionen Dollar gegen√ºber 2 Billionen Dollar in Russland ‚Äì, dennoch produziert Russland viermal mehr Munition.   Kriege beginnen mit Munitionsvorr√§ten. Trotz unserer Gr√∂√üe liegen wir mit 4 zu 1 zur√ºck. Das muss sich dringend √§ndern.   Rutte: Wenn wir die Verteidigungsausgaben nicht auf 5 % erh√∂hen ‚Äì mit 3,5 % als Kernanteil ‚Äì, k√∂nnen wir vielleicht unser Gesundheits- und Rentensystem behalten, aber dann sollten wir besser Russisch lernen.   Das ist die Konsequenz. Die Wahrheit mag die Menschen ersch√ºttern ‚Äì aber sie m√ºssen ersch√ºttert werden. Das ist die Realit√§t.",2025-06-10T19:13:09,8

wallstreetbetsGER,"KI Revolution: Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft","Hey ihr Affen! Vor ein paar Wochen hab ich hier schon mal √ºber Alphabet geschrieben und erkl√§rt, warum ich denke, dass die Aktie ein echter Buy ist:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsGER/comments/1kvz6f2/alphabet\_der\_unterbewertete\_kiendgegner\_des/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsGER/comments/1kvz6f2/alphabet_der_unterbewertete_kiendgegner_des/)  Ironischerweise hab ich mir beim Verfassen des Posts damals von ChatGPT helfen lassen. Tja, die Zeiten √§ndern sich, jetzt m√∂chte ich das Ganze um meine eigenen Erfahrungen erg√§nzen.  **Warum Alphabet ein (verdammt guter) Buy ist?**  **Infrastruktur:** Ganz einfach: Es ist nicht nur die √ºberragende Infrastruktur, in die sich KI nahtlos integrieren l√§sst. Denkt an YouTube, das Werbegesch√§ft, Gmail, Maps, Android ‚Äì> das ist ein √ñkosystem  **Waymo:**  Eine ernstzunehmende Konkurrenz mit deutlich mehr Erfahrung und Pr√§zision im autonomen Fahren. Die haben echte Robotertaxis am Start, w√§hrend andere noch von ""Full Self-Driving"" tr√§umen.  **Google Cloud:** Unfassbar viel Rechenpower, die sie an Kunden vermieten k√∂nnen, die dann wiederum KI f√ºr lukrative Gesch√§ftsmodelle nutzen. Das ist wie Goldminenbesitzer im Goldrausch, sie verkaufen die Schaufeln an alle, die graben wollen, und verdienen dabei richtig Kohle. (aktuell verkauft NVIDIA die Schaufeln an KI Unternehmen).  **Googles Datenhoheit:** Sie haben durch die Google Suche einen unfassbar tiefen und genauen Einblick in unsere Interessen und unser Verhalten. Und mehr Kontrolle √ºber ihre Daten.  Und sie besch√§ftigen sich l√§nger mit KI als die meisten anderen Big Techs.  Es stimmt, sie waren fr√ºher vorsichtiger, gerade wegen ethischer Bedenken:  [https://financialpost.com/technology/google-rush-ai-ethical-lapses-employees-say](https://financialpost.com/technology/google-rush-ai-ethical-lapses-employees-say)  [https://www.focus.de/finanzen/boerse/rene\_will\_rendite/die-rene-will-rendite-kolumne-code-red-chatgpt-bei-google-herrscht-alarmstimmung\_id\_185249242.html](https://www.focus.de/finanzen/boerse/rene_will_rendite/die-rene-will-rendite-kolumne-code-red-chatgpt-bei-google-herrscht-alarmstimmung_id_185249242.html)  Man wollte nicht zu schnell vorpreschen und m√∂gliche negative Auswirkungen in Kauf nehmen. Aber als OpenAI mit ChatGPT um die Ecke kam und das ""Kerngesch√§ft"" der Suche bedrohte, klingelten bei Google die Alarmglocken. Und wenn KI Googles Kerngesch√§ft killen k√∂nnte, muss Google es eben selbst killen.  **KI-Werbung:** Wer ""QualityLand"" gelesen/geh√∂rt hat, kann sich einen ungef√§hren Wert ausmalen. Da schl√§gt dir die Werbung nicht irgendein Produkt vor, weil du zuf√§llig in einer Zielgruppe bist (z.B. Student, 20-30, zockt gerne), sondern die KI kann die Infos, die sie √ºber dich hat, so gut einordnen, dass sie dir GENAU DAS Produkt vorschl√§gt, das du haben m√∂chtest. Und ich sag euch, die Leute werden sich sogar dr√ºber freuen! Ich hab vor ein paar Monaten ewig mit ChatGPT diskutiert, welcher Rucksack perfekt f√ºr meine Reise w√§re. Und ich muss sagen, ich bin super happy mit dem Teil, der war perfekt und hat sich auf meiner letzten Reise echt bew√§hrt.  \-> KI-gest√ºtzte individuelle Werbe-Empfehlungen k√∂nnen verdammt n√ºtzlich sein!  Und nun zum anderen Wettbewerbsvorteil, der gerade so richtig Fahrt aufnimmt:  **Pr√§zision:** Gemini ist jetzt schon fast genauer als ChatGPT... und wird immer pr√§ziser! ChatGPT f√§ngt immer mehr an zu fantasieren. Und das ist verdammt gef√§hrlich. Es ist eine Sache, wenn eine KI sagt ""Ich wei√ü es nicht genau, aber..."", aber eine ganz andere, wenn sie sagt: ""Das wei√ü ich ganz sicher, die Antwort ist so und so!"", und dann totalen Bullshit erz√§hlt.  Ich hab davon gelesen und ein YouTuber hat das auch super beschrieben:  *The Morpheus - Warum KI immer d√ºmmer wird:*  [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeEs3HpuH9I&t=1281s&ab\_channel=TheMorpheus*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeEs3HpuH9I&t=1281s&ab_channel=TheMorpheus)  Warum das so ist, wei√ü selbst OpenAI nicht genau. Hier kann es mehrere Gr√ºnde geben: ""Schei√üe rein = Schei√üe raus."" Das Problem bei ChatGPT k√∂nnte sein, dass man zu schnell zu viel wollte. Die KI ist zwar voll mit Daten, aber da ist anscheinend so viel M√ºll dabei, dass sie manchmal einfach falsch Infos hat und dann so tut, als w√ºsste sie es genau. Das ist super gef√§hrlich, zum Beispiel beim Coden.  **Die Frage bestimmt die Antwort:** Vor allem ist mir aufgefallen, dass ChatGPT manchmal biased ist. Wenn ich frage: ""Ist das so und so?"", dann kann es passieren, dass sie so freundlich und nett ist, dass sie sagt: ""Ja genau, du hast recht, es ist so und so."" Wenn man dann aber kritisch wird und fragt: ""Ist das nicht doch eher so und so?"", kommt: ""Ja, ups, hast recht."" Sie l√§sst sich also aufs Glatteis f√ºhren.  **""Faulheit"":** ChatGPT wird gef√ºhlt fauler.  Ich habe ChatGPT gefragt:  ""Wie lange kann man am 9. Juni 2025 bei Trade Republic handeln?"" Hier impliziert meine Frage sogar schon, dass gehandelt wird. Trotzdem bekomme ich diese Antwort:  https://preview.redd.it/pvq65t00f46f1.png?width=336&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdb8569fcc5d94d1611bbe6c45eb45230dbf48e9  Im Nachgang, auf Nachfrage, hat ChatGPT sich aber korrigiert:  https://preview.redd.it/m133qm15f46f1.png?width=565&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd55b64a737f0185438062b84e2577ec598010c9  Das ist super gef√§hrlich! Ich habe vor kurzem ChatGPT Fragen zu Haltungsbedingungen von Gottesanbeterinnen (Mantiden) gestellt. Nachdem ich diese Situation hatte, dachte ich mir: ""Der Grund, warum ich die KI frage, ist ja, weil es zu den Haltungsbedingungen in Mantidenforen so viele Meinungen gibt und ich mir hier eine klare oder keine Antwort erhoffe (im Sinne von: 'ist nicht ganz gekl√§rt'). Aber was, wenn ChatGPT sagt, die Art braucht diese und diese Temperatur/Bedingungen und das stimmt halt nicht?  Sowas sollte eine KI bedenken und nicht voreilig antworten. (weitere Gr√ºnde sind in dem Video zu entnehmen).  Es scheint, als w√ºrde ChatGPT auch ""fauler"" werden:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1kljkp1/gemini\_vs\_chatgptpro\_is\_chatgpt\_getting\_lazier/?tl=de](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1kljkp1/gemini_vs_chatgptpro_is_chatgpt_getting_lazier/?tl=de)  Hier auch ein Post vom User sharpfork, der aus dem Grund √ºberlegt zu Claude zu wechseln:  https://preview.redd.it/mjdc6ceug46f1.png?width=343&format=png&auto=webp&s=232d7d26231c521d5c4413f158de3d042ddcf292  \-> Ja er √ºberlegt zu Claude zu wechseln, aber mir geht es allgemein darum die Wechselbereitschaft aufzuzeigen, gerade in Bereichen wie Coding.  Gemini hat auf die Frage nach den Handelszeiten am 09.06. √ºbrigens akkurat geantwortet.  Aber davon berichten immer mehr Leute, die ernsthaft mit ChatGPT arbeiten.  Aber versteht mich nicht falsch, ChatGPT ist super. Ich habe aktuell noch ein Pro-Abo und all meine Chats da.  Ich wollte sogar eigentlich diesen Post ironischerweise von ChatGPT √ºberarbeiten lassen, das w√§re diabolisch... aber ChatGPT ist bei mir down -> Habe darum Gemini genutzt und bin zufrieden mit dem Ergebnis.  Aber ich werde wohl irgendwann dauerhaft zu Gemini wechseln, weil Gemini von Mal zu Mal einfach besser wird und dabei (scheinbar) genauer. Auch Gemini hat Macken. Und wichtig: **Auch Gemini halluziniert (noch?)!**  **Veo 3:** Veo 3 ist krass und Ja, andere werden nachziehen, aber es ist Gold wert, in der Branche die beste Videogenerierung (mit Ton!) zu haben. Filmemacher und Kreative wollen den besten Film, nicht den zweitbesten generieren. Eine F√ºhrungsstellung in diesem Bereich ist insane, gerade wenn man √ºberlegt, was teure (Werbe-)Produktionen kosten.  **KGV:** Einer meiner Lieblingspunkte, weil das f√ºr mich als jemand der schon eher daran interessiert ist langfristig zu investieren (warum ich dann hier unterwegs bin? Ich finds unterhaltsam und bin selbst mal Zocker gewesen und manchmal kickt die Sucht auch noch rein).  Das KGV, das Kurs-Gewinn-Verh√§ltnis. Ich glaube, viele, die hier investieren (und das ist voll fein!), wissen gar nicht, was das ist. Ich bin jetzt auch kein Experte, aber das KGV ist quasi, wie viel ihr f√ºr 1‚Ç¨ Gewinn investiert. Bei Alphabet liegt dieser Wert aktuell bei ca. 19.50. Das bedeutet, ihr investiert knapp 19.44 ‚Ç¨ und das Unternehmen macht damit 1 ‚Ç¨ Gewinn. Alles unter 20 gilt als guter Wert, und f√ºr Investoren wie Warren Buffett ist das einer der spannendsten Indikatoren.  Unternehmen wie Microsoft haben ein KGV von ca. 36.39. Wenn Alphabet mit diesem KGV gehandelt werden w√ºrde, w√§re der Kurs bei ca. 317.10 $ (Basierend auf Alphabets aktuellem EPS von $9.06 und einem KGV von 35).  Und f√ºr mich l√§sst sich aus dem KGV auch die ""Kursgewinn-Fantasy"" ableiten (mein eigenes, erfundenes Wort!).  Tesla hat zum Beispiel ein KGV von ca. 169.55. Warum? Weil in diesem Unternehmen unglaublich viel Fantasy drinsteckt. Teslas Absatz und Gewinn sind nicht einmal nahe dem, was der Kurs angibt. Das soll jetzt kein Tesla-Bashing werden, in vielen Aktien steckt viel Fantasy, und das ist auch fein!  Hier geht es nur darum zu verdeutlichen, dass Alphabet aktuell ohne Fantasy gehandelt wird. Anleger haben Angst wegen Regulierung, Zerschlagung oder zum Beispiel der Abspaltung von Chrome. Das kann passieren und das w√§re schon schlecht, aber Alphabet ist so gro√ü, hat unglaublich viel Geld, die haben schon viele Rechtsstreitigkeiten durch. Die wissen, wie es l√§uft. Und tats√§chlich gibt es zum Beispiel beim Chrome-Browser auch viele Argumente, warum man Google hier keine Monopolstellung, sondern schlicht einen guten Browser gebaut hat (belehrt mich gerne, wenn dem nicht so ist!). Und man darf nicht vergessen, gegen wie viele gro√üe Unternehmen gerade Klagen laufen. Wenn solche Unternehmen alle so niedrig bewertet werden w√ºrden wie Alphabet, w√§re der Nasdaq ja nur noch 40% so gro√ü! (√úbertrieben gesagt). Chrome ist aktuell auch einfach ein krasser Wettbewerbsvorteil, wenn der Wegbricht w√§re das hart. Aber 1. Ist die US Regierung nicht daran interessiert ihre lukrativsten Tech Unternehmen zu schr√∂pfen, die gerade die USA in der KI Revolution anf√ºhren und 2. ist das nur ein Wettbewerbsvorteil von vielen. Es wird selten so hei√ü gegessen wie es gekocht wird.  **Zudem:** Gemini hat ChatGPT aktuell in monatlichen Downloads √ºberholt  Es gewinnt definitiv an Boden und √ºberzeugt immer mehr Nutzer. Google AI-Produkte, die auf Gemini basieren, werden immer beliebter werden und google selbst macht gerade unheimlich viel Werbung.     **Meta platforms - Ein anderer KI Riese:**  Meta hat √ºbrigens auch Potenzial, trotz eines KGV von rund 28. Der Netzwerkeffekt durch Instagram und WhatsApp ist gigantisch, und sie investieren krass in KI. Aktuell m√∂gen ihre LLMs schw√§cher sein, aber sie setzen auf Open Source. Das kann langfristig einen Wettbewerbsvorteil schaffen, denn Meta muss gar nicht die beste KI haben bzw. das werden sie langfristig eh, weil sie sich viel von anderen abgucken k√∂nnen (so wie Meta es schon immer gemacht hat). Zuckerberg wei√ü, wie man Geld macht. Irgendwann sind KIs schon extrem schnell und extrem gut, sodass sicherlich auch die zweitbeste KI ziemlich gut sein wird. Meta plant, voll in den Werbemarkt mit KI-generierter Werbung einzusteigen und wird da krass profitieren k√∂nnen.  F√ºr mich f√ºhlt sich KI aktuell wie das Bitcoin der Zukunft an. Fragt eine KI mal, wer von KI profitieren wird. Sie wird euch sagen: ihr, wenn ihr investiert. Und das sagt eine KI nicht, weil sie Werbung macht. Sie sagt es, weil es die Wahrheit ist.  Sobald eine KI einen Job ersetzen kann, oder sogar mehrere, ist die Kostenersparnis so gro√ü, dass Unternehmen viel daf√ºr bereit sind zu zahlen. Meiner Meinung nach wird die Zukunft krass. Mehr Arbeitslosigkeit (aber nat√ºrlich entstehen auch durch KI neue Jobs), mehr Wert von allen Unternehmen, also reiche KI-Gro√ükonzerne und reiche Anleger.  **Microsoft:**  Brauchen wir gar nicht gro√ü dr√ºber sprechen, jeder wei√ü, dass Microsoft gerade top aufgestellt ist f√ºr das AI Race, aber vergesst nicht: Microsoft besitzt OpenAI ja nicht mal, sondern hat nur Lizenzrechte.  Auch das kann in Zukunft ein Risiko sein, das noch gar nicht eingepreist ist.  Lange Rede, kurzer Sinn. Ich m√∂chte Teil der AI Revolution sein oder ich irre mich und bin der Typ, der sich voll versch√§tzt. Who knows. Aber ich bin dick investiert:  **Fazit:**  Lange Rede, kurzer Sinn. Ich m√∂chte Teil der AI Revolution sein oder ich irre mich und bin der Typ, der sich voll versch√§tzt. Who knows. Aber ich bin dick investiert:  https://preview.redd.it/etl5mgx9n46f1.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ee63ee69a7ded16046d925f925310c06b177c97  Habe daneben aber auch Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia und Co. der Mehrwert der durch Ki generiert werden wird ist real und viele werden krass profitieren k√∂nnen durch KI. Aber nirgendwo ist das Kurspotenzial so riesig wie bei Alphabet.  Und ja, der Text wurde durch KI korrigiert und fl√ºssiger geschrieben‚Ä¶ na und, findet euch damit ab! Im KI-Zeitalter habe ich keine Lust mehr, meine Texte sauber zu formulieren. Daf√ºr haben wir jetzt Maschinen.  **Gew√∂hnungseffekt:**  Und das Argument ""Ja, jetzt haben sich die Leute an ChatGPT gew√∂hnt!"" verstehe ich. Aber ich wei√ü noch, wie in Corona mir Leute erz√§hlt haben: ""Ich denke, mit diesen Masken, das wird dauern, bis wir uns das wieder abgew√∂hnen."" Hab schon da gedacht: Bullshit... Und siehe da, gef√ºhlt zwei Wochen nach Aufhebung der Maskenpflicht hab ich kaum noch welche damit gesehen.  Und ja, viele, die vorher Google gefragt haben, fragen jetzt ChatGPT. Aber gerade durch die ""aktuelle"" Ungenauigkeit von ChatGPT √∂ffnet sich f√ºr Gemini ein Fenster oder zB jetzt wo ChatGPT down ist.  Aktuell fragen wir gerade alle unseren Freund und Helfer und k√∂nnen uns ein Leben ohne Chatty gar nicht mehr vorstellen. Aber sobald Gemini besser/genauer als ChatGPT ist‚Ä¶ werden viele leichtf√º√üig wechseln und je mehr KI in die Google Produkte integriert wird, desto wertvoller wird es.

wallstreetbetsGER,Gesundheit.,"Moin Leute!  Ein Thema das mich nun schon etwas l√§nger besch√§ftigt sind Aktien im Gesundheits Sektor.  Konkret gehts um zwei Kandidaten: Novo-Nordisk und UnitedHealth Group.  Zugegebenerma√üen, nach den ganzen Skandalen um UnitedHealth stehen sie etwas schlecht da, aber ich denke dass das ganze, wie so vieles auf dieser Welt, unter dem Teppich verschwinden wird, und die Firma sich langsam aber sicher wieder Richtung 400$ Marke bewegt.  Zuversichtlicher sehe ich auf Novo-Nordisk. Hier gab es heute nach langen Unsicherheiten nun gute Nachrichten: Ein Londoner Hedgefonds, genauer Parvus Asset Management baut sich eine Position im Unternehmen auf. Es k√∂nnte sich nun der lang ersehnte Aufw√§rtstrend anbahnen, auch wenn wir nat√ºrlich auch da erst am Anfang stehen.  Ich habe mich bei beiden f√ºr jeweils langfristige Calls bis Ende 2025/ Anfang 2026 entschieden, mit Strike OTM, aber noch recht moderat.  Positionen:  Novo-Nordisk:  5000‚Ç¨ - Call 600 DKK Laufzeit 19. Dezember 2025.   Dazu noch 2000‚Ç¨ in Einzelaktien.  UnitedHealth Group:  5000‚Ç¨ - Call 400$ Laufzeit 16. J√§nner 2026.  Und auch dazu noch 1000‚Ç¨ in Einzelaktien.  Zu guter Letzt - keine Aalbehaarung!   M√∂chte gerne meine Strategie mit euch teilen, und mir eure Meinung dazu anh√∂ren:)",2025-06-10T15:17:21,0

wallstreetbetsGER,Affen(weiter)bildung,"Hallo Gehege,  da hier sehr oft Fragen kommen was, warum, wieso passiert m√∂chte ich mal ein paar B√ºcher zur Empfehlung teilen. Ziel soll es sein Markzusammenh√§nge besser zu verstehen, Psychologische Effekte zu erkennen, sinnvolle Entscheidungen zu treffen und sich generell sinnhafter mit dem Thema Finanzen, B√∂rse, Spekulation und Investition zu besch√§ftigen.     Da ich die Aufmerksamkeitsspanne kenne hier ein paar Raketen üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ      Ich habe die B√ºcher √ºberwiegend selbst gelesen/geh√∂rt und f√ºr gut befunden, entsprechend hilft es bestimmt dem ein oder anderen ebenso. Wichtig ist, dass ihr nirgendwo konkrete Strategien oder Handlungspl√§ne bekommt. Vielmehr soll es euch die Werkzeuge an die Hand geben um zuk√ºnftig wirklich zu investieren und nicht mehr nur zu Zocken. (auch wenn ein bisschen Zocken sicherlich nicht verwerflich ist)   Viele B√ºcher gibt es als H√∂rbuch, das ist f√ºr mich auch der beste Weg des Konsums von diesem Wissen.  **Tradingpsychologie ‚Äì So denken und handeln die Profis** \--> Sehr empfehlenswert, der Autor bringt sehr viele Beispiele und ich habe mich des √ñfteren dabei ertappt, genau das zu machen, was der Autor im n√§chsten Satz als ""ung√ºnstiges Verhalten"" deklariert. Es geht um Fomo, √Ñngste und was das mit uns Macht, erkl√§rt warum wir dann handeln wie wir es tun und was wir dagegen tun sollten. Auch allgemeinpsychologisch werden einige Themen angerissen, da die Prinzipien denen der Finanzpsychologie √§hneln.      **Die Kunst, √ºber Geld nachzudenken** \--> aktuell wohl mein Lieblingsbuch von Kostolany zu dem Thema Spekulation, Herdentrieb, Psychologie und dem Verstehen von Zusammenh√§ngen. Viele Zitate und Geschichten von einem der erfolgreichsten Spekulanten der Zeit, immer versehen mit seinem Witz.      **Tradingstrategien mit Hebelprodukten** \--> kostenloses eBook vom Emittenten HSBC, recht umfangreich, aber nicht tiefgreifend. F√ºr Affen, die schon ein paar Kenntnisse haben, aber nett zu lesen. [https://www.hsbc-zertifikate.de/pdfs/produktbeschreibungen/TradingstrategienMitHebelprodukten.pdf](https://www.hsbc-zertifikate.de/pdfs/produktbeschreibungen/TradingstrategienMitHebelprodukten.pdf)      **Charlie Munger: Ich habe dem nichts mehr hinzuzuf√ºgen** \--> der zweite Mann hinter Berkshire hat viele interessante Anekdoten und Geschichten zum Thema Finanzen, Psychologie und Visionen f√ºr Assets und M√§rkte aufgeschrieben. H√∂re ich gerade als H√∂rbuch und kann es sehr empfehlen.      **Die Essays von Warren Buffett: Die wichtigsten Lektionen f√ºr Investoren und Unternehmer** \--> Das ist eine Sammlung der Investorenbriefe von Warren Buffet. Es ist eher zusammenhanglos geschrieben und erkl√§rt viel zu seinem Vorgehen. Z.b. wird erl√§utert warum es bei Berkshire keinen Aktiensplit gab und geben wird. Warum niedrigere Berkshire Kurse f√ºr das Unternehmen (und die Investoren) von Vorteil sind und was die Denkweise dahinter ist. Sehr spannende Einblicke, manchmal aber etwas z√§h.  **Professioneller B√∂rsenhandel: Zusammenh√§nge erkennen, Verluste verkraften, solide Gewinne machen** \--> sehr gut geeignet f√ºr Einsteiger und noch relativ unerfahrene B√∂rsianer. Gespickt mit vielen Geschichten aus seiner Ausbildungszeit erkl√§rt der Autor Marktzusammenh√§nge, Marktteilnehmer, deren Psychologie, Risikomanagement, technische Parameter wie Indikatoren und Oszillatoren und vieles mehr. F√ºr mich im Grunde ein Standardwerk um mit dem B√∂rsenhandel zu beginnen.  **Psychologie der Massen** \--> dickes Ding und schon etwas √§lter. Nicht unbedingt auf das Thema Finanzen gem√ºnzt, erkl√§rt Le Bon die Hintergr√ºnde zur Psychologie in Gesellschaften. Nicht unbedingt einfach zu lesen (das Buch wurde 1895 geschrieben) aber weiterhin ein Standardwerk der Psychologie. F√ºr Hartgesottene wom√∂glich interessant, f√ºr mich reicht das einmalige lesen.  Das waren erstmal die Sachen die mir spontan einfallen. Ggf. erg√§nze ich noch ein bisschen in Zukunft.      Meine Top 3 sind:  \- Die Kunst, √ºber Geld nachzudenken   \- Tradingpsychologie   \- Professioneller B√∂rsenhandel  Gr√º√üe und viele üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",2025-06-10T10:05:19,16

wallstreetbetsGER,Rheinmetall gewinnt Neuauftrag f√ºr CWA 2000,"* **Rheinmetall gewinnt Neuauftrag f√ºr CWA 2000** * **Renommierter Kunde in Nordamerika** * **Auftragswert im zweistelligen MioEURBereich** * **Einsatz erfolgt in mittelschweren und schweren Elektrotrucks** * **Fu√üabdruck f√ºr Komponenten f√ºr das Thermomanagement von Elektrotrucks vertieft**    Der Technologiekonzern Rheinmetall hat sich einen zweistelligen MioEURAuftrag eines renommierten nordamerikanischen Fahrzeugherstellers aus dem Bereich Trucks gesichert. Der Auftrag bezieht sich auf eine mittlere sechsstellige St√ºckzahl der Hochvolt-K√ºhlmittelpumpe CWA 2000 f√ºr den Einsatz in batteriebetriebenen mittelschweren und schweren Nutzfahrzeugen des Herstellers. Ab dem Jahr 2028 bis 2035 beliefert Rheinmetall den Kunden direkt.  Den Ausschlag f√ºr die Beauftragung haben die technischen Eigenschaften des Produktes gegeben. Die CWA 2000 ist eine vielseitige L√∂sung f√ºr unterschiedliche K√ºhlanforderungen. Sie ist grunds√§tzlich f√ºr batteriebetriebene Elektrofahrzeuge ebenso geeignet wie f√ºr einen Brennstoffzellenantrieb. Die CWA 2000 besitzt eine lange Lebensdauer und ist f√ºr die Spannungsebene HV3b ausgelegt, die eine Betriebsspannung von bis zu 850V erlaubt. Sie ist wahlweise mit einer aktiven oder passiven Hochspannungs-Verriegelungsschleife ausgestattet, die das Batteriesystem betriebsbereit h√§lt, solange die Schleife geschlossen ist. Bei Unterbrechung sch√ºtzt dieses System durch Abschaltung aber alle Personen, die w√§hrend des Lebenszyklus eines Elektrofahrzeugs mit Hochspannungskomponenten in Ber√ºhrung kommen k√∂nnten.  Dieser Auftrag ist ein Vertrauensbeweis des Kunden in die Technologie von Rheinmetall f√ºr den nordamerikanischen Markt. Der Auftrag ist auch von strategischer Bedeutung, da Rheinmetall hiermit seinen Fu√üabdruck f√ºr Komponenten f√ºr das Thermomanagement von Elektrotrucks vertiefen kann. Es ist ein wichtiger Schritt mit Blick auf die Transformation der Antriebstechnik.  Die Division Power Systems ist Systemanbieter f√ºr hochwertige und innovative (Mobilit√§ts-)L√∂sungen, Steuerungstechnologien und digitale Applikationen unter anderem f√ºr die Automobil- und Energiewirtschaft.",2025-06-10T09:28:03,63

wallstreetbetsGER,Hatte ein Vision,"Keine Anlageberatung. Nur ein Traum? Vielleicht auch mehr.  Boah, ich war im Tiefschlaf. So richtig weg. Und dann: Dieser seltsame Traum. Ich gehe all-in in Palantir und BigBear AI. Mein Depot gl√ºht gr√ºn, Nachrichtenticker laufen hei√ü, irgendwo br√ºllt jemand ‚ÄûHomeland Defense is the future!‚Äú.  Dann wache ich auf ‚Äì und stelle fest: Das, was da in meinem Unterbewusstsein passiert ist, l√§uft gerade in Echtzeit in den USA ab.  Proteste, Paraden & Panik: Was passiert in den USA?  In mehreren St√§dten, besonders in Los Angeles, brodelt es. Grund: ICE-Razzien und aggressive Abschiebungen. Die Antwort der Bev√∂lkerung? Massendemonstrationen, teils eskalierend. Trump? Reagiert wie erwartet ‚Äì mit Nationalgarde, Milit√§rrhetorik und Twitter-Wut (bzw. Truth Social-Rage).  Gleichzeitig bereitet er eine milit√§rische Machtdemonstration am 14. Juni in Washington vor ‚Äì eine Parade im ‚ÄûStarken-Mann-Stil‚Äú, gegen die sich landesweit unter dem Motto ‚ÄûNo King‚Äú Proteste formieren.  Aber w√§hrend die Kameras auf die Stra√üe gerichtet sind, laufen im Hintergrund Deals in Milliardenh√∂he ‚Äì f√ºr KI-Systeme, Datenanalyse und Sicherheitsinfrastruktur.  Palantir & BigBear AI: Die Schattengewinner?  Genau hier wird mein Traum pl√∂tzlich seltsam real: 	‚Ä¢	Palantir Technologies liefert l√§ngst nicht mehr nur ‚ÄûDatenanalyse‚Äú, sondern ist de facto das R√ºckgrat der digitalen Entscheidungsarchitektur f√ºr das Pentagon, Homeland Security & Co. ‚Üí Predictive Policing, Migrations√ºberwachung, Krisensimulationen ‚Äì alles dabei. 	‚Ä¢	BigBear AI stand lange im Schatten ‚Äì doch in der neuen KI-R√ºstungs√§ra w√§chst die Nachfrage nach Echtzeit-Kampfszenarien, Datenfusion, taktischer Lageerkennung. ‚Üí Ger√ºchte √ºber neue Regierungsvertr√§ge, NATO-Testl√§ufe, autonome Grenzsicherung.  Was nach Hype klingt, ist l√§ngst Realit√§t ‚Äì und das spiegelt sich auch an der B√∂rse: Die Aktien beider Unternehmen ziehen wieder an, w√§hrend die M√§rkte auf ‚ÄûKI + Sicherheit‚Äú als neuen Megatrend reagieren.  Traum oder Trend?  Vielleicht war es nur ein wirrer Schlaf. Vielleicht aber war es ein Echo aus der Zukunft: Ein Land im Umbruch, das zunehmend auf technologisch gest√ºtzte Kontrolle setzt ‚Äì w√§hrend die Bev√∂lkerung auf den Stra√üen um ihre Rechte k√§mpft.
